# ultraschall-portable
Portable ULTRASCHALL Podcasting Extensions including the REAPER DAW 

Ultraschall4.1 - development version
Needs currently Reaper 6.12c to work, later versions are untested!

To test it:
1. Clone the repository to your computer
2. Install Reaper into it
    - Windows: install as portable into the cloned-folder
    - Mac: drag n drop the Reaper64.app into the cloned-folder
3. Start the Reaper-app IN the cloned folder.

Keep in mind: this version is unfinished and probably contains bugs. So using this working version is not suitable for productive needs.
If you find bugs and issues, please open an issue about them, so we can have a look.

Thanks :)
