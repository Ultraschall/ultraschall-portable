1. Put the contents of the repository into the "UserPlugins"-folder in the ressources-folder of Reaper
2. Start Reaper and create a new script
3. Type in the following lines:

dofile(reaper.GetResourcePath().."/UserPlugins/ultraschall_api.lua")
ultraschall.ApiTest()

4. A messagebox appears in which you can see, which parts of the API work
5. If it appears, it is correctly installed.

6. Look into 
    Documentation\US_Api_Documentation.html
   for a functions-reference for the API, which will also be added automatically to your actionlist after the first time you used the API.

Thanks for allowing me to use it :)

Kudos to lokasenna, who suggested some cool things, that made some functions much faster and sparkled new ones. Cheers!
