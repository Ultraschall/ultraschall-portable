MediaItemStateChunk Docs(work in progress) by Meo Mespotine(mespotine.de) for the ultraschall.fm-project
        Note: <TAKEFX TAKEFX" still missing, as well as most of the MIDI-stuff like notes and the <SOURCE-tag for MIDI
              MIDI information included in here is probably still wrong!!!
              The rest should be fairly complete and correct, but if you find errors, drop me a note at mespotine@mespotine.de

        integer state - 0, Time; 1, Beats(position, length, rate); 2, Beats(position only)
    
SEL integer state

YPOS number y_pos number y_height
    is position of the item, when "Track Free Item Positioning" is enabled in this track
    disappears, when item is positioned at the top of the track(y_pos=0) and item-height is normal(y_height=0.5)
        number y_pos - the position of the item in the track, 0(top) to 0.949519(bottom, when item height is minimized)
        number y_height - the height of the item; 0.050378(minimum height, equals minimum trackheight) to 1(full trackheight);
                          when dragged by mouse, the minimum height depends on the vertical-height of the track, means: even 0.952381 can 
                          mean minimum height, if the trackheight itself is minimized!

IGUID string iguid

IID integer state
    the item-id, which is basically a counter of all items created within this project. May change, so use it only as a counter. If you want 
    to identify a specific item, use GUID and IGUID instead.
        integer state - the counter, beginning with 1 for the first item


        
<NOTES
|This is a note, where every entry begins with | at the beginning.
|
|This is line three, while the line above is an empty line.
>
RESOURCEFN "graphics-filename.ext"
    a picture, that can be used as background-graphics for the item; can be influenced and set to visible using IMGRESOURCEFLAGS
    disappears, if no image is chosen
        string "filename_with_path.ext" - the path+filename of the image you want to use
        
IMGRESOURCEFLAGS integer flag
    influences, how the text of NOTES or the background-image is displayed, as set up in the Notes-dialog for an item.
    disappears, if no NOTES are given
    The checkboxes "Use as item background" and "Stretch to fit item" can be influenced in here
        integer flag - 0, no checkbox clicked
                       1, "Use as item background" is clicked, so the image from RESOURCEFN will be displayed as item-background
                       2, "Stretch to fit item" is clicked, means, the RESOURCEFN-image or NOTES-text will be stretched to image-size

    The comp of the item.
        integer comp_id - the id of the comp, ordered by creation

    The volume and the pan-settings for the item's-takes, as set in MediaItem-Properties
        number amplification - 0, silence; every 10 is +6dB
        number pan - panning of the item; -1(left) to 1(right), 0 is for center
        number volume - volume of the item; negative values mean "invert phase" is set 0/-1 (minimum) to 3.981072/-3.981072 (maximum volume)
        number pan_law - unknown; default is -1
    
SOFFS number start_offset [number b]
    the startoffset of the take in seconds, as set in the MediaItemProperties "Start in Source"
        number start_offset - the start in source of the MediaItem in seconds
        number b - appears only with MIDI-items. Seems to be the exact doubled value of start_offset. Why that is needs more research.
    
PLAYRATE number playrate integer preserve_pitch number pitch_adjust integer takepitch_timestretch_mode integer optimize_tonal_content number stretch_marker_fadesize
    the playbackrate, pitch, time-stretch-settings of the mediaitem, as set in the media-item-properties
        number playrate - the playrate beginning with 0 for no play at all; 1 for normal-speed-play; 2 for double-speed, etc

        number gate_thres - sets the threshold of the gate; 0(-224dB)-98786.226563(99.89dB)
        number gate_floor - sets the floor of the gate; 0(-224dB)-99802.171875(99.98dB)
        number comp_thresh - sets the threshold for the compressor; 0(-224dB)-98842.484375(99.90dB); 1(0dB)is default
        number comp_exp_ratio - sets the ratio of the compressor/expander; 0.1(1:10.0)-100(100:1.0); 1(1.0:1) is default
        number n - unknown
        number o - unknown
        number fade2 - negative with fade_in set; positive with fadeout-set
        number freq_fade2 - negative with low frequency-fade, positive with high-frequency-fade
    
SPECTOGRAM integer state
    shows the spectrogram, in which you can do spectral-editing, as selected in the MediaItem-menu "Spectral-editing -> Toggle show spectrogram for selected items"
    Disappears, when spectrogram is set to off
        integer state - 1, spectrogram is set to on; when set to off, the whole entry disappears     
    
SPECTRAL_CONFIG integer fft_size
    contains the fft-size for the spectral-view.
        integer fft_size - the fft-size in points; 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024(default), 2048, 4096, 8192

SM number position_a number position_b [number slope] + number position_a2 number position_b2 [number slope2] + ...
    Stretch Marker. One entry includes all stretchmarker-points, who are separated by a + from each other.
    Each stretchmarker-point has the parameters position_a, position_b and optional the slope. The first point(0 0) can be moved to later, but 
    when slope is changed of that moved point, Reaper automatically adds 0 0 to the beginning again. When slope is changed of a point at 0 0, no 
    new point will be added automatically. 
    This behavior is a little confusing at times.
        number position_a - position of the stretchmarker point in seconds
        number position_b - position of the stretchmarker point in seconds
        number slope - -1 to 1; the slope of the rate-change; negative, means downward slope; positive, upward slope
                       0, means no slope, but a straight "horizontal"-slope.
                       It is unknown, how Reaper translates the slope-value into the ratios, shown within the item and especially the exact height-position of the beginning and the end of the slope. It seems to be saved somewhere else. Needs more research.
