Documentation on how to use the StuffMIDIMessage-function in Reaper's ReaScript.

Documented by Meo Mespotine 12th of October 2019 - licensed under creative-commons-license CC-BY-NC


A user had a request for Ultraschall, which involved sending MIDI-messages.
And one of the things I looked at to solve the request, was the function StuffMIDIMessage.

So, long story short: I documented, how StuffMIDIMessages works, so you can actually use it to its fullest.

Lets' begin.

## Background
    One of the interesting things is, that Reaper doesn't differentiate between MIDI and keyboad-shortcuts, means, 
    you can adress them both, as long as you choose the right message.
    That means, you can send MIDI-messages, like notes, cc, pc, pitchbend, including velocity to different areas.
    And even more, you can send MIDI-messages to be treated as "Actions started by MIDI-shortcut" to Reaper, too.
    Another funfact: 
        you can send midi AND computer-keyboard-shortcuts to the Add Shortcuts/Find Shortcuts-dialogs of the Actionslist.
    
    This mirrors, in parts, the way, KEY-shortcut-entries are stored in the reaper-kb.ini-file
    
    Reaper itself stores all its keyboard-shortcuts as well as MIDI-messages as 3 byte sequence:
        
        integer key_midi_modifier    integer key_midinote    integer velocity

   * key_midi_modifier - tells Reaper, whether it is a MIDI-message or a keyboard shortcut. This is also the place to store the 
                         Keyboard-modifiers, like Alt, Shift+Ctrl, Win, etc.
                         How they are encoded is still somewhat odd and unclear, as they are influenced by the key_note-parameter as well.
                         The MIDI-messages you can adress are notes, cc-messages, pc-messages and pitchbend. This modifier is also the
                         place to store, which channel you want to adress.
                         
   Accepted Keyboard-modifiers:
                * Odd Modifier-Values 1-127 (1, 3, 5, ..., 123, 125, 127)
                  The Note/Key-Values go from 0-255 and include the Modifier, 
                  means: modifier 0  key_midinote 65 is "nothing" "Shift+A"
                
                * Even Modifier-Values (0, 2, 4, 6, ..., 122, 124, 126)
                    The Note/Key-Values are pure ASCII and go from 0-255 and don't(!) include the Modifier, 
                    means: 5 65 is "Shift" "A"
                    
                * Special Modifier 255
                    This modifier is the only one, that includes special modifiers, like MultiZoom, Mousewheel, Horizontal-Mousewheel, MediaKbd-keys
                    The following Key/Note-Values are special:
                    When MultiZoom is enabled in the Preferences->Keyboard/Multitouch-page:

                    72=MultiZoom
                    73=Ctrl+MultiZoom
                    74=Alt+MultiZoom
                    200=MultiZoom
                    201=Ctrl+MultiZoom

                    204=Shift+MultiZoom
                    205=Ctrl+Shift+MultiZoom
                    206=Alt+Shift+MultiZoom
                    207=Ctrl+Alt+Shift+MultiZoom
                    When MultiRotate is enabled in the Preferences->Keyboard/Multitouch-page:

                    24=MultiRotate
                    25=Ctrl+MultiRotate
                    152=MultiRotate
                    153=Ctrl+MultiRotate
                    154=Alt+MultiRotate
                    155=Ctrl+Alt+MultiRotate
                    156=Shift+MultiRotate
                    157=Ctrl+Shift+MultiRotate
                    158=Alt+Shift+MultiRotate
                    159=Ctrl+Alt+Shift+MultiRotate
                    When MultiSwipe is enabled in the Preferences->Keyboard/Multitouch-page Multitouch-Swipe-Horizontal:

                    40=MultiHorz
                    168=MultiHorz
                    169=Ctrl+MultiHorz
                    170=Alt+MultiHorz
                    171=Ctrl+Alt+MultiHorz
                    172=Shift+MultiHorz
                    173=Ctrl+Shift+MultiHorz
                    174=Alt+Shift+MultiHorz
                    175=Ctrl+Alt+Shift+MultiHorz
                    Multitouch-Swipe-Vertical:

                    56=MultiVert
                    184=MultiVert
                    185=Ctrl+MultiVert
                    186=Alt+MultiVert
                    187=Ctrl+Alt+MultiVert
                    188=Shift+MultiVert
                    189=Ctrl+Shift+MultiVert

                    191=Ctrl+Alt+Shift+MultiVert
                    Horizontal Mousewheel:

                    88=HorizWheel
                    90=Alt+HorizWheel
                    216=HorizWheel
                    217=Ctrl+HorizWheel
                    218=Alt+HorizWheel
                    219=Ctrl+Alt+HorizWheel
                    220=Shift+HorizWheel
                    221=Ctrl+Shift+HorizWheel
                    222=Alt+Shift+HorizWheel
                    223=Ctrl+Alt+Shift+HorizWheel
                    "normal" Mousewheel:

                    120=Mousewheel
                    121=Ctrl+Mousewheel
                    122=Alt+Mousewheel
                    123=Ctrl+Alt+Mousewheel
                    125=Ctrl+Shift+Mousewheel
                    248=Mousewheel
                    249=Ctrl+Mousewheel
                    250=Alt+Mousewheel
                    251=Ctrl+Alt+Mousewheel
                    252=Shift+Mousewheel
                    253=Ctrl+Shift+Mousewheel
                    254=Alt+Shift+Mousewheel
                    255=Ctrl+Alt+Shift+Mousewheel
   
   Accepted MIDI-modifiers: 
                MIDI Chan X Notes - modifiers 144(channel 1) to 159(channel 16)
                MIDI Chan X CC    - modifiers 176(channel 1) to 191(channel 16)
                MIDI Chan X PC    - modifiers 192(channel 1) to 207(channel 16)
                MIDI Chan X Pitch - modifiers 224(channel 1) to 239(channel 16)
      
   There are more areas, who can store MIDI-messages, but they seem to be unused currently. They are seen by Reaper as hex-codes from 00 to ff.
                MIDI unused  - modifiers 128 to 143, 160 to 175, 208 to 223, 240 to 254
                         
                         
   * key_midinote - this is the place for the midi-note or the key-value.
                    The MIDI-note is between 0 and 127; higher notes repeat the notes, means: 128=0, 129=1, etc
                    The key-code is between 0 and 255; depending on the modifier, they mean different things(including keyboard modifiers or not including keyboard modifiers, see modifiers-description above)

   * velocity - this is the velocity of the MIDI-message you want to send.
                0, note off - use this to send MIDI-messages to Reaper itself, without triggering Effects/Instruments on tracks with MIDI-Input!
                1-255, the velocity to send
                
                With keyboard-shortcuts(mode=1, in the Add/Find Shortcuts-dialog of the Actions-dialog), even values mean no keypress, odd values mean keypress.
                Exception: modifier 255 and notevalue 232++ is various MediaKbd-keys, selected by the velocity-value
                           This is a little bit tricky, as this stores the modifiers in the key_midinote and the MediaKbd-key in the velocity-value, unlike all other keyvalues.
                
                MediaKeyboard-Keys-modifier, as stored in the :
                        For additional MediaKbd-modifier-combinations, add the following values to the key_midinote-Value:
                        +1=Ctrl+
                        +2=Alt+
                        +3=Ctrl+Alt+
                        +4=Shift+
                        +5=Ctrl+Shift+
                        +6=Alt+Shift+
                        +7=Ctrl+Alt+Shift+
                        example: "255, 233, 142" leads to "Special_Modifier, Ctrl +, MediaKbdBrowseHome"
                
                The velovity-values are valid

## The Function

The function itself has 4 parameters, with one for the destination of the MIDI message, and three for the MIDI message itself:

    reaper.StuffMIDIMessage(integer destination, integer key_midi_modifier, integer key_midi_note, integer velocity)


The destination is for the Key/MIDI-message destination, means, where it's sent to.
This is also the parameter to set, if you want to send MIDI-Messages/Keyboard-Shortcuts(latter only in Add Shortcut-dialog) to Reaper itself(mode==1)!

    0 for Virtual Keyboard          - use this to send MIDI-messages to tracks, who have VKB or MIDI as input-device, the key_midi_modifier decides, which channel
    1 for control (actions map etc) - use this to send Keyboard Shortcuts/MIDI-Messages to the Add/Find Shortcuts-dialog in the actions-list, as well as MIDI-Shortcuts to Reaper itself.
    2 for VKB-on-current-channel    - use this to send MIDI-messages to the MIDI-channel, currently selected in the VirtualKeyBoard, key_midi_modifier will be ignored
    3-15                            - seem to be unused...
    
to address other MIDI-hardware:
    16 for external MIDI device 0   
    17 for external MIDI device 1, etc; see GetNumMIDIOutputs, GetMIDIOutputName.
