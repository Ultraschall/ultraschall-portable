# Element
```lua
local Element = require(gui.element)
```
A base class for all GUI elements. This module is typically only used by other
elements, and will rarely be needed for scripts that aren't implementing their
own.

<section class="segment">

### Element:init() :id=element-init

Called when the script window is first opened. Used for any do-it-once
processing, such as assigning and filling graphics buffers. That is, elements
will typically draw themselves to a buffer once on `:init()` and then
blit/rotate/etc from it as needed to draw themselves.
