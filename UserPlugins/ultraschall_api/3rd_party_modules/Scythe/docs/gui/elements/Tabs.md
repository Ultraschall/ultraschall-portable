# Tabs
```lua
local Tabs = require(gui.elements.Tabs)
```
A set of tabs that can be used to manage the visibility of multiple layers.
Tabs are specified using the following structure:
```lua
tabs = {
  {
    label = "Tab A",
    layers = {layer1, layer2}
  },
  {
    label = "Tab B",
    layers = {layer3}
  },
  {
    label = "Tab C",
    layers = {layer3, layer4}
  }
}
```
- Layers may be be present on multiple tabs, in which case they will be visible
when any of those tabs are selected.
- Layers that aren't specified by any tabs will not be affected
