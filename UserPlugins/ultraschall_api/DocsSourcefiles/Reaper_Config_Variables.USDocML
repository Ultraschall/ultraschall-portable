      <title>Introduction to Config Variables</title>  
      <description markup_type="markdown" markup_version="1.0.1" indent="default">  
         List of all Config Variables as of Reaper 6.82 and probably are missing some, but should be fairly complete anyway.  
         These can be used to set configuration-stuff in the preferences, the project-settings, the render-dialog, many context-menus(like MCP or transport-context-menus) and many others.  
         To change them, you can use the following ReaScript API-functions(requires SWS being installed):
          
            >For Integer-values, use [SNM\_GetIntConfigVar()](Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#SNM_GetIntConfigVar), [SNM\_SetIntConfigVar()](Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#SNM_SetIntConfigVar),  
             For Double/Float-values, use [SNM\_GetDoubleConfigVar()](Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#SNM_SetIntConfigVar) and [SNM\_SetDoubleConfigVar()](Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#SNM_SetDoubleConfigVar),  
             For String-values, use [get\_config\_var\_string()](Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#get_config_var_string) and [SNM\_SetDoubleConfigVar()](Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#SNM_SetStringConfigVar)

         as well as the C++-only API-functions:
         
            >For (Global) Configuration, use [get\_config\_var()](Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#get_config_var)  
             For Project-configuration, use [projectconfig\_var\_addr()](Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#projectconfig_var_addr) and [projectconfig\_var\_getoffs()](Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#projectconfig_var_getoffs)  
            
         and Reaper's function:  [get\_config\_var\_string()](Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#get_config_var_string)
          
         who change Reaper's configuration-variables at run time. Just pass the variable-name to the parameter "varname".
          
         Configuration-variables are either double, integer, or string-values. The integer-values are usually(but not always!) bitfields, where every bit stores e.g. the value of a checkbox in the preferences.  
         That said: one variable may contain the settings for up to 32(or more?) settings at once.           
         Some variables are string-variables, but they can be accessed with get\_config\_var\_string(), which is available in pre-releases of Reaper only, at the time of writing(I tried to document them as well anyway).  
         They can also be accessed as integer, but only have the first 8 bytes available(64bits)  
          
         Integer-variables are usually 32bits, only those who can be accessed as string-variable can be read as integer as well up to 64bits-integers.  
          
         I documented bitfields differently than you usually use them. That means, &16384=1 is actually &16384=16384, while &16384=0 is &16384=0. This is only for better readability of the document, not for any technical reasons.  
         Some bitfields are documented as "unknown", though it's uncertain if they're unknown or just unused.  
          
         Sometimes, variables seem not be existing and valid until they've been set somehow. 
         So if you discover a variable as not functioning, keep in mind it might not be set(yet) and therefore not be available. Just set it and it should appear as existing.  
          
         Some variables can't be set. Even if you can set them with new values using the SWS-functions, these new values have no effect on the setting behind them and therefore can only be used for getting their current setting.  
         So test this out beforehand, if you need to get/set a specific variable in your script.  
          
         Setting some of the variables results in a different behavior, as you might expect them to behave.   
         Such example is mastermutesolo, where you can set the master's mute and solo-states successfully, however, the UserInterface of Reaper will NOT reflect that. It rather will show the old mute-solo-state instead.  
         Another such example is reccfg, where you can set another recording-audio-format, but setting it to Video, GIF or AudioCD will result in strange behavior of the Project Settings-dialog, even though you can successfully record in these formats as well.  
         So doublecheck them twice for any side-effects. These sideeffects aren't documented much in here(too much work for one young gal like me ;) )  
          
         I also document limitations with variables within this textfile. These are not taken from actually setting these variables, but rather taken from the limitations imposed by setting-dialogs. So, even if I write about limitations, 
         other values may be possible as well, though I would say, this could lead to unpredictable behavior of Reaper.  
         It is unclear, if the SWS-functions (or the underlying C++ function get\_config\_var) are checking for valid values to reject them, if invalid(and prevent possible crashes, etc).   
         So, be better on the safe side and stay within the boundaries I document.  
          
         I tried to retain the original names of dialogs, settings, menu-entries, checkboxes, etc, so you can search their names in this document to find their accompanying config-variable easier.  
         
         Many variables are also influenced by actions, so refer to [Reaper-All\_ConfigVars\_as\_toggled\_by\_Actions.txt](../misc/Reaper-All_ConfigVars_as_toggled_by_Actions.txt) to get a full list of which actions triggers which configvar.
          
         Keep in mind: 
            
            >If you change settings, these changes might not be stored in Reaper's setting-files, so they may get lost, when Reaper is exited.  
            >If you want to retain settings, you need to set them in the corresponding ini-files as well(usually the reaper.ini) 
            >with BR\_Win32\_WritePrivateProfileString()
            >Only exception I know of is edit_fontsize, which sets the fontsize in Reaper's IDE. Changing this makes this setting immediately persisting.
          
            >Project-settings should be stored the next time a project is saved, but doublecheck that, if storing projectsettings into a projectfile is a must in your script!  
            >Some project-settings can be stored into the reaper.ini as default-project-settings. I documented that as well, when I could find that out.  
          
         documented by Meo-Ada Mespotine mespotine.de for the [ultraschall.fm](http://www.ultraschall.fm)-project  
         some of the variable-names were collected by various users in the Reaper-forums, thanx for that :)

         396 variables documented, including settings for:
         
           >Preferences, Playrate context menu, Help-information display context-menu, Transport-Context Menus, Project Settings, the Master VU-settings,

           >Render to File-dialogs are completely documented, as well as all variables toggled by actions only.  
          
         Some variables I couldn't trigger, so the following 22 aren't documented and are unknown:  
         
           >ctrlcopyitem, disk\_rdblksex, itemdblclk, itemprops, itemprops\_timemode, maxspeakgain, metronome_flags, midiins, midiins\_cs, mousemovemod, newfnopt, projmidieditor, renderqdelay, rightclickemulate, scoreminnotelen, scorequant, selitemtop, titlebarreghide, tsmarker, vstfolder\_settings, projmeasoffsruler, miscopts  
  
         The following variables can be triggered by actions only  
         
           >aot, cueitems, itemtexthide, psmaxv, psminv, templateditcursor  
  
         the following variables are available in pre-releases of Reaper only  
           >none currently

          It is a string, preferences variable.

          This string works like an integer-bitfield, means, you need to convert it to integer.
          After that, each bit(1 through n) represents a MIDI-output-device. If the bit is set to 1, the "Low latency mode(low precision)"-option for this device is set to on, otherwise to off.

          The audioformat for Recording, as set in the Project Settings->Media-dialog

          Setting them changes the recording-format, though setting some will not update the Project Settings->Media-dialog properly (Video, GIF, AudioCD)  
          but will show WAV instead with the additional dialog-boxes for Video, GIF or AudioCD added.  
          If you change the audioformat, it will use the last used setting for the "new" format, as set in this project. Uses the default Reaper-settings for formats in new projects.  
          It is an integer, project variable.
