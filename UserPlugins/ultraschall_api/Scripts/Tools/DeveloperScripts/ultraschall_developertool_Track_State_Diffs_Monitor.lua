Display Track changes in Track-State-Chunks.
  
This displays diffs in a TrackStateChunk, for easier tracking, what changed in a TrackStateChunk.
 
TrackStateChunks include MediaItemStateChunk of MediaItems in that given track, as well as TrackEnvelopes and ItemEnvelopes.

This will display the changed lines(including line-number within the statechunk)
 + the two lines before it (if existing and not being changed lines themselves)

Changed lines begin with:
line xx >>  


Before monitoring it, a dialog will appear that asks you for the track to monitor.
Select the track to monitor by either giving the dialog the tracknumber(1-based)
or by giving it 0 or just hitting ok to monitor the first selected track.

After that, it will ask you, whether to put the changed lines into the clipboard.

When changing a selected track, it will show all lines of the track-state-chunk.
So if you just want to see the change in a selected track, select it first, then apply the change.
