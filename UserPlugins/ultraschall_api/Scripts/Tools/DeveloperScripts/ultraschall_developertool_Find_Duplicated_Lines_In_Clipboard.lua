-- Meo-Ada Mespotine 12th of April 2021
-- Looking for duplicates of lines and displays them in ReaScript-Console, including line and number of appearances.
-- All duplicates will be shown, so if a line is at line 1 and at line 332, it will show both being duplicates, 
-- not only the first duplicate appearing. That way, you know, where all the duplicates are located.

dofile(reaper.GetResourcePath().."/UserPlugins/ultraschall_api.lua")

-- get string from clipboard
A=FromClip()

-- split newlines into individual entries
newline=""
A=string.gsub(A, "\r", "") -- get rid of carriage return(on Windows)
count, individual_values = ultraschall.CSV2IndividualLinesAsArray(A..newline, "\n")

for i=1, count do
  counter=0
  for a=1, count do
    -- look for duplicate lines
    if individual_values[i]==individual_values[a] then
      counter=counter+1
    end
  end
--  print2(counter, string.byte(individual_values[i]:sub(-1,-1)), ultraschall.ConvertAscii2Hex(individual_values[i]))
  if counter>1 then 
    -- if duplicates are found for this entry, show them:
    if bool~=true then bool=true print("\n") end -- show newline once at the beginning, when script finds duplicate
    print("Line "..i.." appears "..counter.." times:"..individual_values[i])
