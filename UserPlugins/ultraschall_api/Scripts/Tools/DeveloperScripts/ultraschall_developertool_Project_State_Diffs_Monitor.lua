Display Project-changes in the rpp-file.
  
This displays diffs in a RPP-projectfile, for easier tracking, what changed in the ProjectStateChunk.

This constantly saves the current project, so be aware of that!
 
Projectfiles include Projectbay, Extension-stuff, TrackStateChunks who include MediaItemStateChunk of MediaItems in that given track, as well as TrackEnvelopes and ItemEnvelopes and many other settings in the project.

This will display the changed lines(including line-number within the statechunk)
 + the two lines before it (if existing and not being changed lines themselves)

It will ask you, whether to put the changed lines into the clipboard.
