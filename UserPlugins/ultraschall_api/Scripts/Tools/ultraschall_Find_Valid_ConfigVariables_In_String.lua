LLLL="TUTUTU"
-- Meo Mespotine (mespotine.de) 15.5.2018 for the ultraschall.fm-project

-- the following code can be used to check, which strings within Reaper are
-- valid config-variables that can be used by the SWS-functions 
--      SNM_GetIntConfigVar(), SNM_SetIntConfigVar(), SNM_GetDoubleConfigVar() and SNM_SetDoubleConfigVar()
-- where you pass the variable-name as parameter "varname".
-- This script expects a string with all entries to check for, each separated by a newline, with no trailing or
-- preceding spaces, as otherwise the variable might be fail-checked.

-- To get a list to check, use Microsoft Process Explorer, start Reaper, rightlick on it and click on Properties.
-- The tab "Strings" contains all strings within Reaper. Click "Memory" and "Save" to save them into a textfile.
-- Open the text-file, copy all(!) entries into clipboard and run this commented code.
-- After execution, it will put all found strings, that are valid config-variables into the clipboard.
--
-- keep in mind: some config-variables are duplicate, often in different camel-cases, some may not be found 
-- by this code (rendercfg seems to be problematic candidate)
-- but at least, it's a start.

-- Oh, and if you want to parse your own reaper.ini(whose entries seem to be a valuable source for variable-names),
-- decomment the first line in the for statement!

-- the variable int_line contains all valid variables, each separated by a \n
-- the variable rest_line contains all strings, that weren't valid variables(where the check failed),
--     each separated by a \n
