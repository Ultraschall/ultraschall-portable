<TODO>
    -- SPectral Edit: supports takes, but do the functions support takes too? Answer: NO, not yet...

    -- later releases
        - IsTakeEnvelopeVisible(könnt knifflig werden)

        - MoveChildWithinParentHWND - hat wohl OffByOne error, wenn relative und width/height=0 gesetzt; tauchte bei Arrangeview auf
        - AddMediaItemStateChunk_in_TrackStateChunk
    
        - ultraschall.Defer - can func==nil be used to use the function, in which Defer-was called?
                        And defer-identifier==nil should be no defer-identifier(defer default)
                        That way, it could be used as ultraschall.Defer()

    
    GetProjectLength - should return the last envelope-point-position as well(how to do that for pooled items?)
    
    OpenURL muss noch url umwandeln auf Ansi Codepage 1252 auf Windows?. Also mit Bat-Datei arbeiten.
    
    RenderPresets: Presetnames with spaces are buggy in GetRenderPreset_Names and deleting-functions
                   filename in GetRenderPreset_RenderTable has issues with spaces in the name, especially if - is in the name due pattern matching-foo
                   
                   solve them with removing the preset/filename using sub() NOT gsub()
    
    
    FX-Names with Reaper's own API-functions have three different types on Mac, for Studiolink On Air.
    I need functions, who take care of that in the API.

Bug with INI-Files-read-functions:
    Cannot read keys with multiple lines(probably limitation of standard), so you need to rewrite your 
    GetIni-Parser....
    Otherwise ini-files and podcast-presets break.

 - Podcast/Episode-Presets have problems with newlines when stored into ini-file -> find a workaround

 - Docs: API - rename parameters of EEL/Python/CPP to their Lua-counterparts
 
 - DeveloperTools: get all default-factory-shortcuts: löschen eines Shortcuts für ne Action.
                   wenn kb.ini einen neuen Eintrag bekommt für KEY mit 0 als action, dann loggen
 
-- Docs: the index is still sorted the wrong way and should be alphabetically downwards, not sidewards
Use this function to do the sorting of slugs for variable HeaderList[i] in line 273 of docgenerator_v2(before the sorting happens with table.sort())

NOTE: check, if the resulting string has the same amount of lines as the one I passed over to it and output an error-message, if it doesn't.
Otherwise, you might miss missing functions in the index, if the code is buggy...

Note: Doesn't fucking work...

- IsEnvelopeTakeFXEnvelope, IsEnvelopeTrackFXEnvelope, IsEnvelopeInputFXEnvelope, IsEnvelopeTakeEnvelope

- add ChapterPlaylists-functions, that allow setting a playlist-order of chapters to play one after another; a playlist name is possible
  I had this added as chapter-attribute, but I think, that this should be an episode-attribute instead, with 
    playlist_1_name="playlist name"
    playlist_1_chapterindex="1, 2, 4, 7, 3"
    playlist_2_name="another playlist's name"
    playlist_2_chapterindex="1, 5, 9, 6, 10"
    
   the chapterindex are the numbers of chapters in timeline-order, that shall be played one after another

- FXStateChunk: GetSet NEXT_FX_OVERSAMPLE 
    toggle to enable/disable all FX instance oversampling settings
  
- Render To Do:
 - GetRenderPreset\_RenderTable - please rewrite, the code is a mess for _EXT. Needs a much more robust solution...
 
 (Later)
 - Add MetaData-Userfield that stores the RenderTable-contents, so it's possible to retain the exact rendering-attributes from the rendered file.
    Probably only ID3, VORBIS COMMENT, IXML and APE, as all others have no USER-field...
    The Userfield should be called "Ultraschall-API RenderAttributes" and probably include the source-project-filename.

ParamModulation: Go fix it, pls...
  https://forum.cockos.com/showpost.php?p=2608181&postcount=765

- Markers:
  SetNormalMarkers(probably others) has problems adressing markers, when markers share the exact same position.
  We need to rewrite this, as otherwise markers get skipped.
  EnumerateNormalMarkers doesn't work because of that.
  Add multiple markers at position 30 secs named A, B and C.
  Try to set the first one of them with a new name multiple times and you will succeed once, then fail. 
    You'll set one of them at the position but never a specific one...

readd in next version
ToDo Marker Menu: 
  - only run action, when mouse-button has been released
  - check, if someone dragged a marker, so a left-click does not run an action when dragging(for later, when left click is activated too...)
    - Region: do not react, when the drag-cursor is shown(mouse hovering at the edges of a region) when left-click
  - prevent # and < > in the beginnings of the description of the marker-menu from the add/set/insert markermenu-entries-functions; do additional parameters instead, that enter it by themselves,
       including the Entry_X_SubMenu=start|end thing.
  - add doubleclick-state as well -> later

  moved
  - PodcastMetadata: GetSetTranscription\_Attributes  gets/sets transcriptions for the podcast(needs either srt or webvtt-files created externally...)
  
  Debug:
    SLEM shows the position in the code of the error-message; try to see, whether this can be used to write a function, that
    returns the current position within the code:
      Debug_CurrentPosition
      
      returning function, source-filename and lineposition of the current code.
      That way, you can do stuff like:
        old=gfx.getchar
        function gfx.getchar(...)
          print(ultraschall.Debug_CurrentPosition)
          old(...)
        end
        
      to see, where in Lokasenna's ui-Lib gfx.getchar is used to debug it with the new UTF8-fixes.
      
      todo: vzoom3 (double) missing in configvar-docs - vzoom2 is math.floor(vzoom3). When settin, vzoom2 and vzoom3 must be set or it can cause issues.

---

### 4.8 - "Sparks - When do I get to sing my way" - 8th of April 2023

Has now 1652 functions, with 37 new ones

**new in this release:**  

  - **Docs-Find-functions**  
  Added now a lot of functions to access the docs of a function directly via API.  
  You can also use the various Find-functions to search for functions matching certain words and slugs.
  With that, you can build your own API-search-tools.
  Oh: and you can search the Config-Vars too!
  
  - **UTF8/string-functions for Lua**  
  Various helperfunctions for dealing with strings and utf8-encoded strings. They'll be added to the string-module of Lua.  
  
  - **Store RenderTable as extstate**  
  You can store and retrieve RenderTables from/to extstates and projextstates. So you can store multiple render-settings in a project.  
  So if you have different render-settings for different parts of your project, you can store and restore them now from extstates without having to spam the render-presets.

### 4.75 - "Soundgarden - Black Hole Sun" - 19th of December 2022

Has now 1615 functions, with 25 new ones

**new in this release:**  

  - **AutoBypass settings**  
  You can now get and set autobypass for projects as well as global preferences, using GetFXAutoBypassSettings and SetFXAutoBypassSettings.   
  You can also force autobypass for an fx, using GetFXAutoBypass\_FXStateChunk and SetFXAutoBypass\_FXStateChunk.
  
  - **Better ErrorMessages**  
  Error messages, returned by functions like SLEM() or SFEM, return now more information about, in which script the error happened, in which function exactly and the linenumber.  
  So debugging is much more easier now.
  
  - **Resize of gfx-images**  
  You can now resize gfx-images, load with gfx.loadimg, keeping aspect ratio, using GFX\_ResizeImageKeepAspectRatio.  
  It's better for making images smaller than making them bigger(causes artifacts) but, you can do it now.
  
  - **Only markers within timerange**  
  The Count markers-functions allow now counting from start to end-position. That way you can get the exact number of markers within the range.  
  
  - **Rendering**  
  supports now "Render stems pre-fader" and "Only render channels that are sent to parent" options; fixed various bugs with them too.   
  You can also get/set, if you want to output statistics-outfiles, using SetRender\_SaveRenderStats and GetRender\_SaveRenderStats.  
  
  - **PodcastMetaData**  
  fixed various bugs, added contributors and websites and a way to export the podcast-metadata as JSON according to the PodMeta\_v1-standard,   
  including setting them into ID3, APE, IXML and VORBIS-COMMENT-metadata storage of Reaper.

### 4.7 - "Pearl Jam - Alive" - 16th of October 2022

Has now 1590 functions, with 58 new ones

**new in this release:**  

  - **Marker Menu**  
  You can code now your own left-click marker-context-menus. Add Entries with MarkerMenu\_InsertEntry and MarkerMenu\_InsertEntry\_DefaultMarkers
  and start the menu with MarkerMenu\_Start. You can add new menuentries or remove them during runtime. So if you add a new marker-menu-entry, it will 
  be shown in the menu the next time the user hits left-click on a marker.  
  And: you can create menus for custom markers as well. So a custom marker called \_ShowNote: can have a different menu than \_AliceInWonderland:
  It also includes regions.  
  And action-marker.  
  
  - **ShowNote/Podcast Metadata**  
  Relevant for podcasting use-cases, you can now add metadata to shownote/normal-markers as well as podcast/podcast-episode metadata.  
  Future versions will include export functions for putting them into the mediafile's metadata.  
  
  - **EventManager - Debug**  
  New features for debugging EventManager stuff, like getting additional states and execution-times. So you can check for performance. 
  And if you don't want to code one yourself: there's a EventManager monitoring-script in the developer-tools, which shows you the 
  execution-times for each check-function-cycle AND the time from after the end of the execution-time until the next one.  
  This allows you to tweak performance for your check-functions. The monitoring-tool even gives you a hint, how low the execution-times  
  must be for Reaper's UI not lagging.
  
  - **Get Project-time by MediaSource-time and the other way round**  
  Get the exact project position from a given source-position or the exact source-position from a project-position.  
  So inserting take-markers at project-position is now possible. Or other cool stuff, where you need to convert the 
  project-position into take-position.
  
  - **ScaleFromDPIFromScale**  
  You can convert now the dpi-value currently set into its corresponding scale-value vice versa. With that, you can always scale 
  your script's ui properly.  
  
  - **Base64De/Encoder, ASCII2HEX2ASCII-enocders**  
  Used to be slow on bigger strings. Not anymore. Sped up by magnitudes...
  
  - **Create/Get-Render-CFG-functions**  
  FFMPEG-support added, NONE as video/audio-format added, wmf-support added  
  
  - **Render functions**  
  Support now marker-rendering and fade-in/out-feature  
  
  - **Bugfixes Bugfixes Bugfixes**

### 4.5 - "Frank Zappa - Help I'm a Rock" - 6th of May 2022

Has now 1500 functions, with 23 new ones

**new in this release:**  

  - **Celebration Time**  
  Because, I reached 1500 functions for Ultraschall-API. In the beginning, I was sure, that I would maybe have potential for 
  300 functions.
  I somehow overdid it, did I? XD
  
  - **Razor Edit**  
  I gave Razor Edit some love, so you can nudge, add and remove razor-edit-areas much easier for tracks or individual TrackEnvelopes.  
  
  - **AutomationItems**  
  As I needed to bugfix the split and delete-functions for Automation Items, I added some functions to mass-set the select states of automation-items.  
  
  - **Developer Actions for ReaScripts**  
  Need to quickly reopen the last edited script? Or want to open up another and you're too lazy to open up the 
  actionlist?
  Behold, new developer-functions do this for you.  
  And if you need to open up quickly a new temporary-script to write some small test-code-snippet, you can do it as well.
  
  - **EditReaScript**  
  Always bothered, that the newly opened script doesn't immediately hold, what you need to start working right away?  
  Well, EditReaScript can now automatically add some default-lines into a newly created script. So if you need to 
  add your ReaPack-index-information time and again, use this new parameter to make stuff easier for you.  
  
  - **Bugfixes**  
  You're used to it, aren't you?
  
  ...up to the next 1500 functions, as soon as my overtyped numb fingers can type again... XD

### 4.2.005 - "Anne Clark - Our Darkness" - 21st of July 2021

Has now 1406 functions, with 6 new ones

**new in this release:**  

  - **Dark Mode in all documentation**  
  Ever been blinded by the light...ehrm docs? Suffer no more. All docs are now in dark-mode, relayouted with a proper  
  color scheme, smaller, faster to load.  
  And I nicked some code from X-Raym's fantastic docs, so clicking on function-calls is now copying them into the  
  clipboard.  
  Also the index has now links that you can link to. So if you want to give somebody a list of all marker-functions,  
  click on the ^ next to the category.  
  The order of functions is also by category. So all marker-functions are next to each other. Endless scrolling to find  
  that one other marker-related-function is now a thing of a past.  
  The header on pages is also sticky now. Endless scrolling to switch page is also now a thing of the past.  
  Enjoy Darkmode.  
  No more sunburns from reading docs. Can you believe it?
  
  - **Normalization on Rendering**  
  You can use now the new normalization-features of Reaper in all rendering-functions.  
  
  - **Parameter Learn**  
  Some of the ParmLearn functions were hard to use, due some parameters being complex. I added variations of them, so  
  setting them is now much more easier.  
  
  - **Toggle Beta-Functions**  
  I almost never finish all new functions, but I deploy them anyway. Though they are not accessible directly, only  
  when Ultraschall-API is set to Beta-Mode.  
  This can now be done in the API-settings.  
  Beta-functions can be found in ultraschall\_functions\_engine\_beta.lua for toying around with them.  
  But keep in mind: they aren't released for a good reason. Be careful with them.
  
  - **Bugfixes**  
  Bugfixes, Bugfixes, Bugfixes...
  
  
#### New features in 4.2.005

### 4.2.003 - "Georg Friedrich Handel - Sarabande" - 6th of February 2021

Has now 1385 functions, with 26 new ones

**new in this release:**  

  - **BatchConvertFiles**  
  Ever fancied programming the batch-converter? Now you can, with BatchConvertFiles. No more fiddling around with command-line.    
  
  - **GetProjectStateChunk**  
  Is now improved and finally working stable. What a difficult birth, but now you can access all your project-states available.  

  - **FXStateChunk-functions**  
  Getting and setting FXStateChunk-entries should be fully supported now. Some can't be set at runtime in Reaper, due some quirks with setting statechunks, but nevertheless.  

  - **GetActionCommandIDByFilename**  
  So here's the story: you have this nice filename of a nice ReaScript and would like to call it for a date or just by Main_OnCommand, but:  
  you don't know the ActionCommandID. GetActionCommandIDByFilename will be your knight in shining armor and give you what you need.  
  
  - **M1-Mac support**  
  Now all scripts using Ultraschall-API run smooth on the new Arm-Macs as well. Dozens of fixes and bugreports made it possible.  

  - **SetUIScale**  
  Now you can scale your Reaper-window to planet-size, by setting its UI-scaling-factor. So if 2 isn't enough for your oldening eyes, set it to 100.  

  - **2nd pass rendering**  
  Also added, so you can use the new 2nd-pass-rendering-feature in your scripts. Loop Loop!  
  
  - **Custom Markers/Regions**  
  They can now be enumerated, set, deleted and count with "" as well. This will give you all custom-marker/regions instead of a specific one.
  
  - **GetItem\_ClickState and GetTrackEnvelope\_ClickState**  
  Stopped working due bugfix in SWS, now returned back to working due bugfix in Ultraschall-API. So getting the currently clicked/dragged item/envelope-point is available again.  
  
  - **EditReaScript**  
  Open a specific ReaScript with a specific window-position and size. So arranging your ReaScript-IDE-windows is now real easy.  
  Under the assumption, you have a taste for a nice IDE-arrangement.  
  
  - **Bugfixes, improvements, speedups**  
  The usual cleanup of old functions that usually eliminate bugs and slow code.  
  
#### New features in 4.2.003      
  - Configuration-files: GetActionCommandIDByFilename - get the actioncommand-id of a registered script

### 4.2.001 - "Pink Floyd - High Hopes" - 1st of December 2020

Has now 1351 functions, with 9 new ones

**new in this release:** 
 
  - **StuffMIDIMessage and KB.ini-functions**  
  You can now convert the KEY-entry-codes of shortcuts(as stored in the reaper-kb.ini) into their text representation: CharacterCodes\_ReverseLookup\_KBIni  
  This is also possible, if you use StuffMIDIMessage to send control-messages, as these can be converted now into their 
  text-representation as well: CharacterCodes\_ReverseLookup  
  Multiple keymaps supported.  
  Oh, and did I mention, you can now also get all currently set shortcuts as a handy table? Optionally with factory-default shortcuts?  
  Now I did: KBIniGetAllShortcuts  

  - **Metadata for AIFF, APE and XMP**  
  As of Reaper 6.16, you can add metadata for AIFF, APE and XMP as well. I also updated the other metadata-functions to 
  feature the lastest metadata-features Reaper can offer.  
  And yes, this includes also support for the new Media Explorer-tags.
  
  - **ConfigVars support in StateInspector **  
  That's right: you can now monitor config-vars in the StateInspector as well. I also removed the fact that I accidentally
  deleted your saved slots with each updated.  
  How come, you didn't tell me that, huh? ;)

  - **CleanUp and Speedup **  
  I made Ultraschall-API much smaller by removing tons of useless files and improving storage of other files by magnitude.  
  To give you a number: Ultraschall-API is 50% smaller compared to the previous release.  
  It also loads now 30% faster, so starting scripts using Ultraschall-API is now close to lightspeed.  
    
  - **Various Bugfixes **  
  The render-string-functions didn't work properly with floats. Mostly fps-settings were affected. Now it's working.  
  Also the StuffMIDIMessage-docs is improved now and more precise.  

#### New features in 4.2.001
   - ConfigFile Management: KBIniGetAllShortcuts - returns all shortcuts of the currently running Reaper-instance as a handy table
   - Helper functions: CharacterCodes\_ReverseLookup - converts the StuffMIDIMessage-bytes(with parameter mode=1) into their character-representation
   - Helper functions: CharacterCodes\_ReverseLookup\_KBIni - converts the first two bytes of the KEY-entries in reaper-kb.ini into their character-representation   
   - Helper functions: RFR - (ReturnFirstRetvals) allows you to get only the first x return-values of a function
   - Helper functions: RLR - (ReturnLastRetvals) allows you to get only the last x return-values of a function
   - Helper functions: RRR - (ReturnRangeRetvals) allows you to get only a range of all return-values of a function
   - Metadata: Metadata\_AIFF\_GetSet - gets/sets the AIFF-metadata of the current project
   - Metadata: Metadata\_APE\_GetSet - gets/sets the APE-metadata of the current project
   - Metadata: Metadata\_XMP\_GetSet - gets/sets the XMP-metadata of the current project

    42 functions give you life, themeiverse and all the rest needed.

    SFEM(for Show First Error Message) is your way to go.  

  - **IsItemVisible and IsTrackVisible**

    54 functions only for that. I must be insane...
    
  - **ParameterModulation**  
    Fixed a bug and therefore added a new feature for parameter linking.  
    ParmModTables have now two entries to set the index of the linked plugin:
    PARMLINK\_LINKEDPLUGIN and PARMLINK\_LINKEDPLUGIN\_RELATIVE.  
    To set an absolute plugin-index, set PARMLINK\_LINKEDPLUGIN=absolute-index and PARMLINK\_LINKEDPLUGIN\_RELATIVE=nil  
    To set a relative plugin-index, set 
      PARMLINK\_LINKEDPLUGIN=any number and  
      PARMLINK\_LINKEDPLUGIN\_RELATIVE=0(current plugin), negative(higher in the FXChain), positive(lower in the FXChain)  
    GetFunctions will usually have the linked plugin indexed in a relative-to-the-current-plugin-index(Reaper's standard behavior).
    
  - **RenderFixes**  
    Renderfunctions sometimes created peak-files when not necessary. This is fixed now and speeds up the time between finished render and returning to the project.

### 4.1.005 - "The Beatles - I want you(she's so heavy)" - 25th of September 2020

Has now 1240 functions, with 25 new ones

**new in this release:**

  - **Parameter Modulation/Learn/Alias/LFOLearn**  
    A long time feature-request finally fulfilled. You have full access to programmatically get/alter parameter-modulation, parameter aliases, LFOLearn or Learn in general.  
    So anything you would want to do with parameter-modulation can now be scripted.  
    I'm curious, what will happen because of that feature. Surprise me.  
    Requested by so many.  
    [Please consider donating](https://mespotin.uber.space/Mespotine/mespotine-unterstuetzen/), as this was a massive undertaking. Holy cow!
        
  - **SLEM**  
    Allows now different output-targets, so outputting the last error-message to the ReaScript-console or even the clipboard is possible with that.  
   
  - **Lua-ReferenceManual**  
    Now included is the Lua 5.3 reference-manual, so it's always at your hand when needed.  
    
  - **Ultraschall-API settings dialog**  
    There's now an Ultraschall-API settings dialog. Not much in there yet, but you can already set, where SLEM() or 
    ultraschall.ShowLastErrorMessage() shall output their error-messages.  
    More to follow.  

  - **Launchpad\_functions**  
    I wrote some launchpad 1st generation-functions, which you can find in the misc-folder. So if you want to be able to program its button's lights, you can do it.  
    
  - **Gmem functions**  
    For those of you, who want to use different gmem-names in your functions, you sometimes run into trouble, that you can't restore the old gmem-attachement again, as you can't get its old name.  
    Now you can. Gmem\_GetCurrentAttachedName returns the last used gmem-attachname. Keep it to later attach the old gmem back.  
    This works best, if you add the dofile-line to activate Ultraschall-API as first code-line in your script.  
    
  - **Filemanager demo**  
    To showcase the background-copying-functions, I wrote a small filemanager demo, which is now available in the example-scripts.  
    It shows you, how you can copy even large files in the background and still manage to run the UI of a script without having to code complex background-copying-routines.      

  - **MB works again on Windows and Linux**  
    Broke in Reaper 6 but I could fix it so replacing the button-texts is possible again. Mac-users are out of luck, as the button-texts can't be replaced there in the first place. Sorry.  
    
  - **GetUserInputs on Mac**  
    Also broke with Reaper 6 due some internal changes of Reaper. I finally managed to make it work again.  
    So you can get and set the captions and retvals again of the GetUserInputs-dialog.  
    Resizing of caption/retval-fields and the positioning of the GetUserInput-window doesn't work on Mac currently, but will return later.  
    So you can use these parameters safely on Mac and one of the future updates will make it work out of a sudden. :)  

#### New features in 4.1.005

### 4.1.004 - "I, E.T." - 21st of July 2020

Has now 1215 functions, with 15 new ones

**new in this release:**

  - **Background Copying**  
    You can now copy files in the background(as additional defer-loops) within your script, while you do other stuff in your main defer-loops.  
    You can set a buffer-size, which means, how much shall be copied per defer-cycle to balance between transfer-speed and possible Reaper-GUI-lags.  
    
  - **TimeToMeasures**  
    This allows you to convert a time in seconds to measures. I've used it in one script to set pre-roll(which only accepts measures) to a length in seconds.  
 
  - **RenderCodes for FFMPEG 4.1.3 on Windows**  
    If you've installed FFMPEG 4.1.3 in your Reaper-installation, you have additional output-render-formats available. I've added docs for these renderstring-settings now as well.  
    
  - **Updated docs, examplescripts and bugfixes**

### 4.1.003 - "Premier" - 1st of July 2020

Has now 1200 functions, with 54 new ones

**new in this release:**

  - **Theme Parameter Access and monitoring script**  
  Since Reaper 6, Cockos added the option of influencing a theme via so called theme-parameters. One such example is WhiteTie's Default Reaper6-Theme,
  which can be influenced via the theme-adjuster.  
  And here's the thing: this can not only be influenced, it can also be programmed.  
  So if you wanted to write scripts, who automatically adjust things without having to use the theme-adjuster, by using GetAllThemeLayoutParameters, ApplyAllThemeLayoutParameters, GetAllThemeLayoutParameters, GetThemeParameterIndexByDescription, 
  GetThemeParameterIndexByName, SetThemeParameterIndexByDescription and SetThemeParameterIndexByName.  
  And if you want to know, which theme-parameters can be set and which values are the right ones, the developer-package includes now a Theme-Parameter monitoring script.  
  With that, you can see altered parameters(in Reaper's default v6 theme, for instance) and use the aforementioned functions to influence them accordingly.  
  Just run the "Script: ultraschall\_Add\_Developertools\_To\_Reaper.lua"-script after installing the update and there you have it.  
  One huge step into theme-customization...  
  
  - **MetaData**  
  Since Reaper has metadata-export-capabilities now, I've added nice and handy functions to get and set them, including docs and everything.  
  The rendering-functions also allow now switching on the metadata-embedding, so there's no excuse anymore to not use it.  
  
  - **LangPack Compare-script**  
  This is probably useful for translators among you. I wrote a script, which compares two ReaperLangPack-files and returns the differences between the two into the clipboard.  
  That way you can compare the most recent official LangPack with a former one and can see immediately, what has been added/altered and into where, so you can update your translation accordingly.  
  Just run the "Script: ultraschall\_Add\_Developertools\_To\_Reaper.lua"-script after installing the update and there you have it.  
  
  - **Envelope Activation**  
  When working with envelopes, especially when scripting, you can not really work with envelopes, unless they are activated. Funny enough: there's no "Activate"Envelope"-function in Reaper's own API.  
  So I tried to find ways around it.  
  With ActivateEnvelope(good for send-envelopes), ActivateTrackPanEnv, ActivateTrackPreFXPanEnv, ActivateTrackPreFXVolumeEnv, ActivateTrackTrimVolumeEnv, ActivateTrackVolumeEnv you can activate most of 
  the most important envelopes and therefore script them.  
  Some are still missing, so I hope, I can add the missing ones too...
  
  - **TrackManager**  
  It has been requested in the feature-request subforum and the general-forum: functions for the trackmanager.  
  Thing is, it is quite useful, but there are simply no actions available for it, even though having shortcuts set to some of the basics can be very handy.  
  So I added TrackManager\_ClearFilter, TrackManager\_OpenClose, TrackManager\_ShowAll, TrackManager\_SelectionFromProject, TrackManager\_SelectionFromList, TrackManager\_SetFilter who allow you to script many 
  of the ui-elements of the track manager.  
  
  - **Lokasenna's Gui Lib v2**  
  now part of Ultraschall-API. Just run the function Lokasenna\_LoadGuiLib\_v2, which loads the GUI-Lib version deployed with Ultraschall-API including all its classes and the rest is the same as you are used to.  
  There's nothing to worry, if you've already installed Lokasenna's GuiLib v2, as the version I deploy is independent of it.  
  So you can safely use both on one system.
  
  - **Ignore-Audio checkbox of video-items**  
  This is requested from time to time again, so I finally added it: the possibility to set the "ignore audio"-checkbox of a video-item.  
  GetItem\_Video\_IgnoreAudio and SetItem\_Video\_IgnoreAudio are the functions of your choice.  
  
  - **Setting Aliasnames for FX-plugins**  
  Not available in the regular API, but in Ultraschall-API. This has been requested shortly before this release, a way to set the alternative/alias name of track and item-fx.  
  A demofile US\_Api\_Examples\_SetAliasNamesOfFX-Plugins.lua shows, what you can do with it...  
  
  - **SetTimeUnit**  
  Allows setting the timeunit of the transportfield, the ruler and the alternative ruler. Good for toggling through-actions...  
  
  - **Image Handling**  
  ResizeJPG, ConvertPNG2JPG and ConvertJPG2PNG give you more control over managing different image-files.  
  
  - **Bugfixes and other stuff**  
  For rendering, FXChains(as requested), updated nomenclature of functions, SLEM allows now getting more than just the last error-message, etc, etc

### 4.1.002 - "The Buzzcocks - Why can't I touch it" - 8th of June 2020

Has now 1146 functions, with 17 new ones

**new in this release:**

  - **Video window-Toggle Fullscreen**  
  You can now toggle the video-window fullscreen/non-fullscreen via VideoWindow\_FullScreenToggle. 
  
  - **Activate/Deactivate Mute-envelopes**  
  Wasn't possible until now: activation and deactivation of Mute-Envelopes, as otherwise you cannot write to them.
  
  - **MuteActions more stable**  
  They should now set mute-envelope-points properly, no matter of mute-env-armstate and/or automation-mode.
  
  - **Project-Diffs-Developertool**  
  Reimplemented, so it shows only the diff-lines now.
  
  - **Benchmarking-functions**  
  You can have multiple benchmark-slots, so benchmarking multiple values at the same time is now possible.  
  That way, you can benchmark the whole script and individual functions in one go.
  
  - **Item Buttons can be now toggled**  
  Now, you can toggle the buttons shown at the top of the MediaItem, like mute, FX, Envelopes, etc. Change them in one go, to have different "profiles"
  of MediaItem-buttons, that reflect the usecases of your different projects.
  
  - **PreventUIRefresh and RestoreUIRefresh**
  Like Reaper's own PreventUIRefresh, but prevents accidental misuse of its counter, as the counting up is done by PreventUIRefresh and the "reset" of a  
  PreventUIRefresh can be undone by RestoreUIRefresh.  
  When using RestoreUIRefresh(true), all ultraschall.PreventUIRefresh-calls are reset, so the user-interface of Reaper is useable again.
  
  - **bugfixes and readdition of accidentally deleted function..oops ;)**

### 4.1.001 - "Radiohead - Spectre"

Has now 1129 functions, with 18 new ones

**new in this release:**

  - **Automation Items**  
  You can get all automation-items as well as deleting the ones you want to delete.  
  That's right, you can now safely delete one programmatically!

  - **Rendering functions**  
  Support now the new rendering options of Reaper 6.10: embedding Take markers as well as Do not render files that are likely silent.  
  Note: Reaper 6.10 has a bug, which prevents simultaneously from setting Add to Project and Do not render files   likely silent-checkboxes of the Render to File-dialog. Fixed in later versions of Reaper.

  - **SetTrack\_LastTouched**  
  Allows you to set a track as last touched, which wasn't possible before.

  - **SetTrack\_Trackheight\_Force**  
  Sets the trackheight of a track to any height you like, including heights not allowed by the theme.  
  That way, you can set the trackheight to e.g. 1px, allowing you better organisation of your arrangeview's tracks.

  - **CollapseTrackHeight**  
  Speaking of trackheight, this function collapses tracks to the minimum height allowed by the currently selected theme.

  - **GFX\_GetDropFile**  
  Call it frequently when having opened your gfx-window, and it will return drag'n'dropped files as well as the dropping-position within the gfx.init-window. No need to fiddle it out by yourself.

  - **ActionsList\_GetSelectedActions**  
  Returns all selected entries from the opened actionlist, including Action Command Ids, texts, etc.  
  Kudos to Edgemeal, who wrote the initial version of it.

  - **IsTimeSigmarkerAtPosition**  
  Already implemented for markers and regions, I added it for time-signature-markers as well.  
  Returns, if a time-signature-maker is at a certain position.

  - **and more plus bugfixes**  

Kudos to Lokasenna and to Xenakios. Hope you both return at some point to the Reaper-community.

### 4.00 Beta 2.9: - "Gentle Giant - Two weeks in Spain"

Has now 1111 functions, with 32 new ones

This is the last beta-release for the Ultraschall-API4.00 and the feature-freeze-version. Until the final one, I will only fix bugs.  

**new in this release:**

  - **Render\_Loop**  
  You can render now loops, including so called "wet-loops" which are loops, who include reverb and other such effects.  
  For them to be renderable properly, they need to "build up" the effects first until it sounds right.  
  Render\_Loop does exactly that with 2-pass-rendering. The first one is the part, which includes the loop itself+the effects-buildup.  
  So it renders the part of the project until the reverb is build up fully+the actual part to be looped.  
  The second pass will cut the actual loop out of the first-pass-render and put it where you want it to be.  
  You can also influence the fadein/out time and style of the second-pass-rendering, so you can avoid clickings and pops due harsh cuts 
  at the beginning or the end of a loop.
  
  - **Secondary Rendering Support**  
  This is so hot, it only exists(yet) in pre-releases of Reaper. You can set a secondary render-format. And if you render your project, it will render out into both files.  
  That means, you can render your project as WAV+MP3 at the same time.  
  And all rendering-functions of Ultraschall-API support that new feature, including the current project, projectfiles, render-presets.  
  
  - **Marker-functions and Guids**  
  All marker/region-functions return now the guid of the marker/region as well. Which is really nice for storing additional metadata for markers/regions.  
  You can also request the markers/regions by guid now.  
  
  - **Envelope States**  
  You can read now all envelope-states available. Setting will come soon as well.  
  
  - **GFX\_Init**  
  Allows you now to center the window by setting x and/or y-position to nil
  
  - **MoveFileOrFolder**  
  Tired of copying your files around when you just want to move them? Or folders? Behold: MoveFileOrFolder moves files and folders for you.  
  This speeds up moving files around in Lua by magnitudes.
  
  - **FXStateChunks and RFXChainFiles**  
  You can load/store FXStateChunks from/to RFXChainFiles, which are the FX-Chain-files you can save within the FX-Chain-window.
  
  - **Capturing Screen and Windows**  
  You can now capture screens and windows for screenshots(CaptureScreenAreaAsPNG and CaptureWindowAsPNG).  
  Thanks to edgemeal for that.  
  
  - **GetTCPWidth**  
  returns the width of the TrackControlPanel.
  
  - **More and bugfixes**  
  as usual ;)

### 4.00 Beta 2.80: - "Starsailor - Four to the Floor"

Note: Ultraschall-API needs now Reaper 6.02 or higher. Please update to Reaper 6. It's worth it!  

Has now 1079 functions, with 20 new ones and 23 deprecated ones removed

**new in this release:**

  - **Improved Defer Management**  
  Ultraschall.Defer allows you now to set and get the timer-settings of a given ultraschall.Defer-cycle.  
  You can even do this from the outside of the deferred script!  
  You can also protect now ultraschall.Defer-cycles from being stopped from the outside.
  
  - **Rendering functions**  
  The RenderPreset-functions do work again, after some changes in the way Reaper stores render-presets since Reaper 6.02.  
  They also allow you to use: preset-names with spaces. (I know, this should have been in there from the beginning... ;) )  
  
  - **GetItem\_ClickState**  
  Is now fully functional. That means, if you call this function in every defer-cycle of a script, you can actually monitor clicked and dragged MediaItems.  
  This will open up new ways of editing and item-manipulation, like RippleDrag, etc.
  
  - **FXStateChunk**  
  They can now be counted, added, removed and gotten. Means: I added the missing functions for working with them, so you can fully work with FXStateChunks now.  
  XRaym will love that :D
  
  - **GetProjectLength**  
  unlike Reaper's own API-function GetProjectLength, this one returns the end of the last itemedge, the last regionedge, marker and time-sigmarker

  - **Easy Clipboarding**  
  FromClip and ToClip allow you now to get/put strings from/to the clipboard without having to type gazillions of characters.  
  
  - **GetProject and GetTrackState-functions**  
  I completely reworked most of them, so they will now return all values, even those, which I haven't put into the docs yet.  
  That means, if the devs add new values, you can retrieve them right away, without being dependent on me to add them.  
  Will do the same with the Set-functions in the future.

### 4.00 Beta 2.79: - "Yes - Owner of a lonely heart"

Has now 1082 functions, with 12 new ones

  **New in this release:**
  
  NOTE: There are some new features, who make use of Reaper v6-features. Please update soon, as Reaper 6 will be a requirement soon!  
  
  - **Speedup when loading US-API**  
  I made a modules-system, which speeds up loading and initalization as well as memory-use of the Ultraschall-API by magnitudes.  
  This approach loads only the functions needed by your script(used to load all functions in earlier versions).  
  The loading is now about 86% faster and memoryuse is 56% less.  
  And what do you need to do to make use of the modules approach?  
  Well, nothing. The Ultraschall-API does it for you! (requested by many, so hope, this helps you a lot).  
  
  - **Marker/Region Extstates**  
  Reaper 6.02 added some new features, which gives a unique guid for a marker. This again, helped me adding a feature I wanted to have for a long time: Marker/Region Extstates. 
  They work like regular ProjectExtStates, but have the benefit, that they allow saving additional key-value stores associated with a certain marker/region.  
  And even if you change the whole order of the markers, the extstates will still be attached to the marker of your choice.  
  Possible usecase: storing the render-format-settings as region-extstates for region-rendering or simply adding additional metadata to markers/regions, that are needed but would spam the markertitle shown in the arrangeview.  
  Experiment with it, you'll quickly get the idea and ideas for practical usecases!
  
  - **Blitting an image centered**  
  Sometimes, you want to blit an image into gfx-windows centered. Problem is: it's not easy to do. Until now, as I added the function 
  GFX\_BlitImageCentered, which does exactly that.  
  That means, you can pass to the function the position of the center of the image and change rotate/scale. This makes zooming in and out of images much more easier, as they stay at their position.  
  
  - **Subtitles SRT-import/export**  
  You can import and export now SRT-files for subtitles. This should allow you to use regions as subtitle-feature.  
  
  - **ConvertStringToBits and ConvertBitsToString**  
  This can be helpful, if you have a string, which represents a binary-number: Just convert it with this function and voila, you can work with the bits themselves.  
  And if you need to do it the other direction, use ConvertBitsToString. That way, you can work easily on a bitlevel, if fiddling with bitshifting is too difficult for you.  

  - **Bugfixes with ArrangeViewSnapShots, Markers**  
  Should now work like a charm.
  
#### New features in 4.00beta2.79
   - API: loadspeed - sped up loading speed by 86%, as API will now only load functions, actually needed, not all of them; memory need is reduced by about 56%.
   - Docs: Reaper Internals - updated to Reaper 6.02
   - ExtStateManagement: GetMarkerExtState - gets an extstate from a specific marker/region
   - ExtStateManagement: SetMarkerExtState - sets an extstate for a specific marker/region

   - Helper Functions: ConvertBitsToString - converts a table with bits(entries with 0 or 1) into its string-representation
   - Helper Functions: ConvertStringToBits - converts a string into its bit-representation

### 4.00 Beta 2.78: - "Tchaikovski - Overture 1812" - 5th of November 2019

Has now 1070 functions, with 41 new ones

  **New in this release:**
  
  - **Event Manager**  
  Additional functions and features to improve handling, development, monitoring and debugging of events.  
  Fixed some bugs, that need startup-events to be readded again. Sorry for that.
  
  - **SLEM**  
  like ultraschall.ShowLastErrorMessage() but faster to type. I should have added this much more earlier.  
  
  - **MIDI-notes**  
  Now you can send easily Midi: notes, cc-messages, pc and pitchbends.
  
  - **Defer**  
  One Defer-function to rule them all. You can set, how often to run the defer-cycle and give it an identifier.  
  With that identifier, you can stop that specific defer-cycle from the outside!  
  Way better than killing all scripts with the action "ReaScript: Close all running reaScripts".
  
  - **PingMe**  
  Puts out a message including linenumber and function, in which the PingMe-function was executed.  
  You can output the message in the ReaScript-console, as messagebox and into the clipboard, even retaining old clipboard-contents.  
  This can be used as simpler version of hooks to monitor internal behavior.  
  
  - **StateInspector supports gmem**  
  You can monitor now gmem-states as well, which is handy for developers of JSFX and Video-Processor-related scripts.  
  
#### New features in 4.00beta2.78
   - DeferManagement: Defer - runs a deferred loop; you can decide how often it runs; allows you to give it a unique identifier to access, watch and stop it from anywhere!

### 4.00 Beta 2.77: - "Monkeys with Tools - Call the planet doctor" - 1st of October 2019

Has now 1029 functions with 44 new ones! Yes, I crossed the thousand!  

  **New in this release:**
  
  - **Event Manager**  
  Killer Feature Time and long requested by many of you!  
  The EventManager allows you to run actions, when certain states occur/statechanges occur.  
  That way you can automatize running actions under certain circumstances without having to run your own defer-script for that.  
  Kudos to @fernsehmuell, who was essential in the initial designs of it!
  
  - **ShowXXXInputMenu**  
  Shows different Context-menus, like TrackInput, TrackPanel, TrackArea, TrackRouting, Ruler, MediaItem, Track/TakeEnvelope,  
  EnvelopePoint, EnvelopePoint for Automation Items, AutomationItems-contextmenu.  
  Reaper's own function ShowPopupMenu is quite difficult to use, so I made some, who make it easier.  

  - **RunLuaSourceCode**  
  Runs Luacode directly without having to create a script for it.  
 
  - **Main\_OnCommand\_LuaCode**  
  Runs Luacode as child-script directly without having to create a script for it.  
  
  - **GetTimeByMouseXPosition**  
  returns projecttime at x-screenposition, which can be nice for mouse-editing-specific actions.  
  
  - **ReplacePatternInString**  
  Like Lua's string.gsub(), this replaces a pattern within a string with a replacement string, but you can choose,  
  which one shall be replaced. And unlike string.gsub() only that one will be replaced, not the occurences after that.  

  - **GetItem\_ClickState and GetTrackEnvelope\_ClickState**  
  Return, if a MediaItem/EnvelopePoint is currently clicked and hovered by the mouse. Could be used for some nice and handy things.

  - **GetAllActions**  
  Sped up and returns now more attributes, like action-type(script, native, custom, extension), termination-state of scripts, consolidate-state for custom actions.

  - **ConvertFunction\_FromBase64String and ConvertFunction\_ToBase64String**  
  Convert a Lua-function to/from a BASE64-string. That way, you can exchange functions via extstates. Convert to Base64-string, put the string into an extstate,  
  read the string from the extstate and convert it back to a function.  

  - **Bugfixes and optimzations**  
  Optimized and bugfixed tons of other stuff, thanks to many bugreports and a lot of feedback from many of you.  
  Big thanks for that :)

### 4.00 Beta 2.761: - "Coldplay - Fix You" - 23rd of August 2019

Has now 985 functions with 8 new ones!

**IMPORTANT!: This is a massive critical bugfix release. About 60 functions returned wrong returnvalues in case of an error.  
If you use any of the functions listed in _Changes from Beta 2.76 to Beta 2.761_, you should check, if your scripts still work.  
This is totally my fault, as I had some of them wrong to begin with.  
My apologies for any inconvenience.... :/**  

  **New in this release:**
  
  - **Critical Bugfixes**  
  In case of errors, many functions returned wrong returnvalues or had faulty returnvalues stated in the docs. All of them are fixed now.  
  Please check, if your scripts use any of the functions listed in Changes for more details.  
  Hope this is the last time, stuff like that happened...
  
  - **GetProjectStateChunk**  
  gets a full StateChunk of the current project(finally working!)  
  Now you can get all states of your project!  
  
  - **MediaExplorer**

  - **ConvertYCoordsMac2Win**  
  Y-coordinates on Mac are different from the ones in Windows/Linux, meaning, pixel 0 is at the bottom, while Windows/Linux start on top.  
  This function converts the y-coordinates between these two coordinate-systems.  
  
  - **New version of Config-Vars-displayer-script**  
  Shows changes with doubles without a problem now, is faster, uses the config-var-docs included with the API to get the currently accepted config-vars.
  I also improved the layout a bit.
  
#### New features in 4.00beta2.761

### 4.00 Beta 2.76: - "The Police - Walking on the Moon" - 20th of July 2019

Has now 977 functions with 42 new ones!

  **New in this release:**
    
  - **Parameter Learn**  
  You can set/get/delete parameter-learning in Statechunks.  
    1) get a StateChunk  
    2) get its FXStateChunk using GetFXStateChunk  
    3) alter this FXStateChunk using the ParmLearn-functions  
    4) set this FXStateChunk using SetFXStateChunk  
    5) (re-)apply the final StateChunk to the Track/Item  
    
  - **Localize**  
  You can localize your scripts using an external localize-file.   
  If that exists, ultraschall.Localize will convert your string into it's localized one, otherwise it uses it's original text.  
   
  - **DocEngine**   
  long time on my list, functions for the DocEngine. With them, you can use my Reaper-internal-sourcefiles (.USDocML) and create your own conversions of them.  
  
  - **get\_action\_context\_MediaItemDiff**  
  a function, which helps you to get the diff of an MediaItem since last time calling this function. Good for RippleDrag-features.  
          
  - **AddSelectedItemsToRenderQueue**  
  this adds MediaItems into the Render-Queued, either as single-queued or multiqueued-project-files(requested by Travesty)  

  - **GetUserInputs**  
  allows now setting the length of the captions-fields.  
  No more cutting off of longer captions!(requested by Julian Sader)  
  
  - **More functions, more bugfixes, updated Reaper-docs, speedups**

## Ultraschall Framework - Changelog

### 4.00 Beta 2.75: - "Nick Cave & the Bad Seeds - Babe, I'm on fire" - 29th of May 2019
tagline inspired by a comment from \_stevie\_ ;)
  
  **!RenderMania Update!**
  Has now 935 functions with 95 new ones!
  
   - **Rendering** - reworked Rendering completely; you can render the current project now directly, access render-presets and render-queues (thanks to Justin and Schwa for adding the features needed into Reaper)
   
   - **Render-Format-strings** - you can create all(!) renderformats available in Reaper as BASE64-encoded strings, as well as analyzing already BASE64-encoded renderstrings(this alone is 44 functions)
   
   - **Parameter Learn** - you can get all parameter learn, modulation and lfo-settings, as well as FXStateChunks who store that information, add/set/delete will come later (requested by TonE and Anton9)
    
   - **ultraschall.MB** - shows a messagebox and allows exchanging the texts of the buttons with your own texts
   
   - **LoadFunctionFromExtState and StoreFunctionInExtState** - lets you pass a Lua-function from one script to another using an extstate, no external files and loads and requires necessary

   - **Docs** - updated docs for Reaper 5.978, SWS 2.10.0.1, JS-extension 0.986
   
   - **More Docs** - when you've installed the API using ReaPack, actions will be added for opening the individual parts of the docs, like Reaper API(ReaScript, Video, WebRC), ConfigVars, Ultraschall-Concepts and FunctionsAPI. Type into the Actions-dialog-filter the words "ultraschall" and "help".
   
   - **Example Scripts** - when you've installed the API using ReaPack, new actions for registering and unregistering the example-scripts as well as opening the example-script-folder. Type into the Actions-dialog-filter the words "ultraschall" and "examples".
   
   - **Even more about docs** - docs for parameter-learn added(thanks to Anton9 for helping me with that) as well as many docs I had lying around(find them in the ResourceFolder/UserPlugins/ultraschall\_api/Misc/misc\_docs-folder)

   - **CleanUp** - removed junk and converted files into smaller fileformats(where applicable), so the API is now 20MB smaller
   
   - **Many other helpful functions** - HexString2Ascii2HexString, Get/Set Armstate of Envelopes, DeleteTracks\_TrackString, Get/SetCheckboxState and more
   
   - **Bugfixes** - as usual ;)


If you find this helpful and use this, please consider donating to me at ultraschall.fm/danke (look for mespotine), paypal(lspmp3@yahoo.de) or patreon.com/mespotine.  
Might be a small donation for you, but a giant motivation leap for mankind(means: me) ;)

### 4.00 Beta 2.6: - "Is that all there is? - Peggy Lee" - 19th of October 2017

#### New features in 4.00beta2.6 - has now 450 functions, with about 30 new ones:

  - CreateAllTracksTrackString - creates a trackstring with all tracks in the current project
  - new datastructure "EnvelopePointObjects" and "EnvelopePointArrays"(for EnvelopePointObjects) for easier massworking with envelopepoints
  - CreateEnvelopePointObject - creates an EnvelopePointObject
  - GetEnvelopePoint - gets envelopepoint easier than Reaper's own functions. Returns value converted to db-value as well
  - GetClosestEnvelopePointIDX\_ByTime - gets envelope-point-idx closest to a given timeposition
  - GetEnvelopePointIDX\_Between - gets envelope-points between start and endtime
  - AddEnvelopePoints\_EnvelopePointObject - adds an EnvelopePointObject
  - AddEnvelopePoints\_EnvelopePointArray - adds an array of EnvelopePointObjects
  - CheckEnvelopePointObject - checks, if an EnvelopePointObject is a valid one
  - DeleteEnvelopePoints\_EnvelopePointObject - deletes an envelope-point, according to the EnvelopePointObject 
  - DeleteEnvelopePoints\_EnvelopePointArray -  deletes envelope-points, according to EnvelopePointObjects in EnvelopePointArray
  - SetEnvelopePoints\_EnvelopePointObject - sets an envelope-point, according to the EnvelopePointObject 
  - SetEnvelopePoints\_EnvelopePointArray - sets envelope-points, according to EnvelopePointObjects in EnvelopePointArray
  - CountEnvelopePoints - counts envelope-point in a given track and envelope-name

  - WriteValueToFile\_Replace - replaces specific lines in a file with value
  - GetLengthOfFile - returns length of a file
  - ReadBinaryFile\_Offset - reads a binary file. Allows partial reading of a file as well.
  - WriteValueToFile\_InsertBinary - inserts a value into a binary file at specified position
  - WriteValueToFile\_Replace - replaces a specified portion of a file with a value
  - GetStringFromClipboard\_SWS - returns the content of the clipboard, using the SWS-function reaper.CF\_GetClipboardBig, but manages the stuff
      necessary, that surrounds using this function
  - SecondsToTimeString\_hh\_mm\_ss\_mss - converts seconds into a timestring of the format hh:mm:ss.mss
  - TimeStringToSeconds\_hh\_mm\_ss\_mss - converts a timestring of the format hh:mm:ss.mss into seconds
  - ParseMarkerString - converts a string with markernames or a string with timestrings and markernames into an array
  - RenumerateMarkers - renumbers the shown-marker-ids in the project, beginning with the first one to the last one. Good for
                "ordering" markers, that were included in unordered way.
