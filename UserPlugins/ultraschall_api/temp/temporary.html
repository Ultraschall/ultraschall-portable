<p>I can't believe it, but after over one and a half years, I can finally write these last words for this mammoth-project.<br />
But what can I say, what I haven't said in this docs?</p>
<p>Feel free to use it. Feel free to code with it. Feel free to learn from the functions I wrote. Dig into the functions-reference, which holds much much more.</p>
<p>If you like it, you can donate to our project at: <a href="https://www.ultraschall.fm/danke">ultraschall.fm/danke</a>.</p>
<p>Let me take some more time to thank to the many Reaper-Forum-users, who provided me with ideas, hints, bits and pieces and tons of information, which itself informed this API.<br />
I don't want to pick up anyone specific, so if you think, I want to thank you for your ideas and contributions, help or whatever, I do exactly that:<br />
Thank you :)</p>
<p>Let me also thank the Reaper-guys Justin and Schwa, who created this piece of great software. Even though I constantly throw more and more Feature-requests into the forum, I'm deeply impressed with this piece of software and the more I dive into it, the more I can find.<br />
Reaper is like a fractalised fractal: the closer you get, the more details are revealed.</p>
<p>More thanks also to the whole podcast community in Germany, be it at PodStock, ChaosCommunicationCongress, Sendegate, which gave me more than just countless hours of good entertainment and information. You probably saved my life countless times and I don't know how many podcasts I listened through in the endless hours of coding this monster.<br />
Without you, I wouldn't have survived coding this.</p>
<p>Also thanks to the wonderful Ultraschall-team, whose focus on improving Reaper for podcasters shows, what is possible in Reaper and how powerful this software is. And who answered ma tons of questions.<br />
And who survived my constantly being annyoing with this API ;)<br />
I want to thank in particular Ralf Stockmann, whose rant in the Sendegate brought me into the project and back into programming.<br />
Though, after not having seen the lights of the days for months now, I'm not sure, whether this was a good thing ;)</p>
<p>Thanks also to all the other people who supported me over the years. I dedicate this thing to you. And for someone special even a whole function, yay :D</p>
<p>So, that's all for now. Feel free to work with it and have fun.</p>
<p>I go to sleep now. I think, I deserved it :)</p>
