Documentation on how to use the StuffMIDIMessage-function in Reaper's ReaScript.

Documented by Meo-Ada Mespotine 11th of November 2020 - licensed under creative-commons-license CC-BY-NC

A user had a request for Ultraschall, which involved sending MIDI-messages.
And one of the things I looked at to solve the request, was the function StuffMIDIMessage.

So, long story short: I documented, how StuffMIDIMessages works, so you can actually use it to its fullest.

Lets' begin.

## Background
    One of the interesting things is, that Reaper doesn't differentiate between MIDI and keyboad-shortcuts, means, 
    you can adress them both, as long as you choose the right message.
    That means, you can send MIDI-messages, like notes, cc, pc, pitchbend, including velocity to different areas.
    And even more, you can send MIDI-messages to be treated as "Actions started by MIDI-shortcut" to Reaper, too.
    Another funfact: 
        you can send midi AND computer-keyboard-shortcuts to the Add Shortcuts/Find Shortcuts-dialogs of the Actionslist.
    
    This mirrors, in parts, the way, KEY-shortcut-entries are stored in the reaper-kb.ini-file
    
    The parameters of StuffMIDIMessage work as follows:
    
        integer mode_destination    integer byte1    integer byte2    integer byte3

#mode_destination:
    The mode_destination is for the Key/MIDI-message destination, means, where it's sent to.
    This is also the parameter to set, if you want to send MIDI-Messages/Keyboard-Shortcuts(latter only in Add Shortcut-dialog) to Reaper itself(mode==1)!

        0 for Virtual Keyboard          - use this to send MIDI-messages to tracks, who have VKB or MIDI as input-device, the key_midi_modifier decides, which channel
        1 for control (actions map etc) - use this to send Keyboard Shortcuts/MIDI-Messages to the Add/Find Shortcuts-dialog in the actions-list, as well as MIDI-Shortcuts to Reaper itself.
        2 for VKB-on-current-channel    - use this to send MIDI-messages to the MIDI-channel, currently selected in the VirtualKeyBoard, key_midi_modifier will be ignored
        3-15                            - seem to be unused...
        
    to address other MIDI-hardware:
        16 for external MIDI device 0   
        17 for external MIDI device 1, etc; see GetNumMIDIOutputs, GetMIDIOutputName.
    
    If mode_destination is set to VKB or MIDI-devices, byte 1 is the channel, byte 2 is the note/CC or PC-value and byte 3 the velocity

    If mode_destination is set to 1 (for control-messages), you can send keyboard-commands to the add-shortcuts dialog.    
    The following rules apply in this case:
        
      Modifiers:
        0   - 159 Keyboard Modifier - second byte the key, third byte mostly unused
                                      byte3: &1=0, normal character-codes(byte2); &1=1, adds 128 to byte2
                bitfield: &1=0, ASCII-character set with control-keys(Tab, Esc, Enter, etc)
                          &1=1, ASCII-character set without control-keys
                          &4, Shift
                          &8, Ctrl/Cmd(on Mac)
                          &16, Alt/Opt(on Mac)
                          &32, Win/Ctrl(on Mac)
        160 - 175 MIDI-messages as three byte hex
        176 - 191 MIDI CC - first byte channel, second byte CC-number, third byte unused
        192 - 207 MIDI PC - first byte channel, second byte PC-number, third byte unused
        208 - 223 MIDI-messages as three byte hex
        224 - 239 MIDI Pitch - first byte channel, second byte unused, third byte unused
        240 - 254 MIDI-messages as three byte hex
        255, Special Modifier
            regular modifiers are moved to byte 2 and keys to byte 3
                modifiers are encoded as this:
                         &1, Ctrl/Cmd(on Mac)
                         &2, Alt/Opt(on Mac)
                         &4, Shift
                         &8=0, Win/Ctrl(on Mac)
                         &8=1, No Win/No Ctrl(on Mac)
                         
                      The following need byte_three&1 set to 1!                      
                         24=MultiRotate, when MultiRotatate is enabled in Preferences->Keyboard/Multitouch-page
                         40=MultiHorz, when MultiSwipe is enabled in Preferences->Keyboard/Multitouch-page
                         56=MultiVert, when MultiSwipe is enabled in Preferences->Keyboard/Multitouch-page
                         72=MultiZoom, when MultiZoom is enabled in Preferences->Keyboard/Multitouch-page
                         88=HorizMouseWheel
                         120=MouseWheel 
                         152=MultiRotate, when MultiRotatate is enabled in Preferences->Keyboard/Multitouch-page
                         168=MultiHorz, when MultiSwipe is enabled in Preferences->Keyboard/Multitouch-page
                         184=MultiVert, when MultiSwipe is enabled in Preferences->Keyboard/Multitouch-page
                         200=MultiZoom, when MultiZoom is enabled in Preferences->Keyboard/Multitouch-page
                         216=HorizMouseWheel
                         248=MouseWheel 
                         
                      The following accept byte_three&1 set to either.
                         104 or 232, will make byte three signalling numerous variants of MediaKbd-keys(no WIN as modifier supported)

    Note, how you cannot send MIDI-notes with mode_destination=1. If you want to send MIDI-notes to the add-shortcuts-dialog,
    you need to use another mode_destination-mode.
    BTW: if have set mode_destination=1 and you you use MIDI-messages as shortcut, you can even start actions by them, as long 
    as the action isn't started yet. This seems to be not that stable from ReaScript though.
