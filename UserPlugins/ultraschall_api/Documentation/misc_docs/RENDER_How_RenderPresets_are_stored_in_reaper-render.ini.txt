Render-Presets-docs as of Reaper 6.71

The render-presets are stored into reaper-render.ini in the resources-folder of Reaper.
Depending on what you chose for storing a preset, when hitting the Presets-button in the Render to File-dialog, the following entries
are added into that file.

!Note for Reaper 5 users: Reaper 6 changed the format of the reaper-render.ini, so some various-checkboxes moved to various_checkboxes2, the latter wasn't present before.

When selecting "Options and format" or "All settings":
    <RENDERPRESET string presetname  integer SampleRate  integer channels  integer offline_online_dropdownlist  integer useprojectsamplerate_checkbox  integer resamplemode_dropdownlist  integer various_checkboxes integer various_checkboxes2
      string rendercfg
    >
    
    <RENDERPRESET2 string presetname 
      string rendercfg2
    >
    
    RENDERPRESET_EXT string presetname  integer normalize_mode  number normalize_target  number brickwall_target  number fadein_length  number fadeout_length  integer fadein_shape  integer fadeout_shape
    
When selecting "Bounds and Outputpattern filename" or "All settings":
    RENDERPRESET_OUTPUT string presetname  integer bounds_dropdownlist  number start_position  number end_position  integer source_dropdownlist_and_checkboxes  integer unknown  string outputfilename_renderpattern  integer tail_checkbox  string output_directory  integer tail_length_ms

As mentioned, Presets, who are stored by the menu "All settings" have both of these entries with the same presetname, all others only one of them.
They will be shown in the Render-preset-menu accordingly.
As soon, as they are in the reaper-render.ini, they will be shown the next time you click the Render-preset-button in the Render to File-dialog.

Some general notes on the Render-Presets:
    - any changes in this file will be used by Reaper immediately, the next time the Presets-Button is 
      hit in the Render to File dialog    
      
    - Some settings aren't stored in presets:
        Silently increment filenames to avoid overwriting-checkbox
        Add rendered items to new tracks in project-checkbox
        Do not render files that are likely silent-checkbox
        Save copy of project to outfile.wav.RPP-checkbox
        Delay queued render to allow samples to load-checkbox
        Delay queued render seconds-input box - so you can't store the amount of seconds to wait before a queued render is processed
        
    - RENDERPRESET_OUTPUT - the purpose of parameter "integer unknown" is unknown, maybe legacy value of features who got removed?
    
    - string rendercfg - this parameter in <RENDERPRESET holds the output-fileformat-settings as Base64-encoded string, 
                         refer to RENDER_How_RenderCFG-Base64-strings_are_encoded for how they are constructed
