For some time now, it is possible to use Cocko's own screen-recording tool "LiceCap" directly from Reaper(https://www.cockos.com/licecap/).
Run the action: 41298 - "Run LICEcap (animated screen capture utility)", which will open a dialog window, where you can select the LiceCap-app from.
                The next time you run this action, LiceCap will be started right away.

The path to the licecap-app is stored in the reaper.ini: [REAPER] -> licecap_path, like
    licecap_path=LICEcap\licecap.exe
This path can be relative, so you can copy the LiceCap-folder into your Reaper-App-Folder, when using a portable installation. 
That way, you can take LiceCap anywhere, where you take your Reaper with you.

LiceCap stores its preferences-values into LiceCap.ini, that can be located in the same folder as the app itself.
The following settings are stored into the LiceCap.ini.

[licecap]
lastfn=C:\Program Files (x86)\LICEcap\z.gif
            last used filename
            
wnd_r=0 1 1133 703 
            position of the capture-frame: x_left y_top x_right y_bottom in pixels
            negative values are allowed, so positioning of the LiceCap-window outside the top and left border of the viewport is possible
            default is: 0 0 835 571
            x_right and y_bottom must be bigger than x_left and y_top, or LiceCap uses it's default values
            x_right and y_bottom can't be bigger more than a few pixels behind the border
            
maxfps=99 
            max frames per second, minimum value is 1
            maximum value is 2147483647
            negative values produce weird fps-values within the LiceCap-App
            
prefs=x - bitmask
            &1 - display in animation: title frame - checkbox
            &2 - Big font - checkbox
            &4 - display in animation: mouse button press - checkbox
            &8 - display in animation: elapsed time - checkbox
            &16 - Ctrl+Alt+P pauses recording - checkbox
            &32 - Use .GIF transparency for smaller files - checkbox
            &64 - Automatically stop after xx seconds - checkbox
            
titlems=1200
            show titlecard-length in milliseconds
            negative values are allowed, though useless
            maximum is 1410065400, though 2147483600 seems to be settable
            
gifloopcnt=98
            .GIF repeat count (0=infinite)
            negative values are allowed, though useless
            0 is minimum value, 2147483647 is maximum value, higher than that makes it negative
            
stopafter=1200      
            automatically stop after xx seconds, in milliseconds
            negative values are allowed, though useless
            2147483600 is maximum value
            
title=Titlesequence  
            text for the title-card, newlines will be ignored, after reload!
