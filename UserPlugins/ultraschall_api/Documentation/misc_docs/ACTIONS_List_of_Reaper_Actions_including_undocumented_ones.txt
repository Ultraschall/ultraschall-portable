Compiled by Meo-Ada Mespotine(mespotine.de) for the ultraschall.fm-project

This list contains all actions for Reaper and SWS, available in Reaper 5.941 and SWS 2.9.7 
At the end of the list, you can also find actions, that are only available for use in menus, like project-lists or template-lists.

1. Introduction
    This section covers Action and Command IDs, that you can call/request to make Reaper certain things. For example, if you call the 
    Action Command ID 1007, you trigger the play-button, leading Reaper to start playback. It is very important for programming Reaper, 
    i.e. the Web-Api to make web interfaces using Reaper's functions.
    ActionCommandIDs can be either a number(most built-in Actions from Reaper have one) or a string, that is either given by Reaper 
    itself(usually beginning with _RSsomething) or defined by you in the reaper-kb.ini-file.

    Built-in functions in Reaper usually have a number, while Scripts and Actions have a string(refer to Reaper-kb.ini docs for more 
    information about that).

    You can dump all regular actions/commands with their IDs and ActionCommandIDs using the SWS-Actions:
        _S&M_DUMP_ACTION_LIST	SWS/S&M: Dump action list (native actions only)
        _S&M_DUMP_SWS_ACTION_LIST	SWS/S&M: Dump action list (SWS actions only)
        _S&M_DUMP_CUST_ACTION_LIST	SWS/S&M: Dump action list (custom actions only)
        _S&M_DUMP_CUST_ACTION_LIST	SWS/S&M: Dump action list (all actions)
        _S&M_DUMP_CUST_ACTION_LIST	SWS/S&M: Dump action list (all but custom actions)
    Just open the Actions-List within Reaper, search for them and click "Run".
    About ReaScripts, Actioncommand IDs and CommandID-numbers
    When you create a new script or action, Reaper will associate to it a so called "Action Command ID", which is a string 
    (ReaScripts: 42 characters that starts with RS, Actions: 32 characters, NOT starting with RS) of letters and 
    numbers(i.e. RS928ab6efab86388ed866f72e8a87ba8727ebaf82). 
    This ActionCommandID can be called to run the script, associated with that given ActionCommandID, from many functions, menus, 
    themerelated stuff, WebApi, etc.
    In addition to that, Reaper also associates to the script a so called CommandID(as seen in the Reaper Action Command ID - Numbers-list below).

    Reaper has a lot of builtin-actions that trigger functionality within Reaper. Every Action has a so called CommandID, hardwired to this function.
    For example: the CommandID 1007 starts playback.

    When you browse through the CommandID-numbers, you may notice, that many numbers are not set yet. These yet unset numbers can be associated 
    by Reaper to one of your new Reascripts that you've created. This could be important, if you want to use the reaper.SetToggleCommandState() 
    or reaper.GetToggleCommandState()-functions, as they do not accept the Action-Command IDs-strings, only CommandID-numbers!

    Unfortunately, Reaper isn't very consequent in associating this number. In fact, two different installations of Reaper may associate a different 
    CommandID-number to a given ReaAction or ReaScript, so on one installation, Reaper may associate the number 60000 to a given script, while on 
    the other system, Reaper associates to it 60001, making scripts, that try to toggle CommandStates with a number 60000 not working! 
    So hardcoding numbers isn't a good idea, if it's not one of the built-in CommandID-numbers provided by Reaper(like in the numbers-lists below) 
    that always stay the same.

    That means, you need to find the actual correct CommandID-number by using functions like reaper.get_action_context(), that returns 
    the correct CommandID-number for the script you want to call, but only, if you call them from within that script! If you want to 
    get the CommandID-number of a script out of another script, use the NamedCommandLookup()-function.
    Important, if you want to i.e. add your own buttons to a theme, that you want to toggle on/off
    
    Why Reaper creates this hassle can only be speculated on, though the following might be a plausible explanation:
    When the Reaper-developers add a new Action, they will associate to it one of the unused numbers, so from that time on, you can call 
    this Action by using this newly given number, let it be 60000. Now imagine, the number 60000 would also be "hardwired" to one of your 
    own scripts you created, Reaper would have a problem to know, if it should call the new Action, or your script.
    One may say "the script, as it was before the new Action!", but imagine, you want to use this new Action in a new script: 
    no chance of calling it, only the script associated with the number 60000.
    So I think, Reaper would use the 60000 for the new Action, giving to your script another, yet unused number(i.e. 60001) to avoid 
    conflicts of multiple associated CommandID-numbers.

    Important: The ActionCommandIDs will stay the same, once they are associated and added to the reaper-kb.ini to a given script. 
               That means, it is always safe to use them. Only the CommandID-numbers aren't that safe, so you need to get them first 
               using reaper.get_action_context() or NamedCommandLookup() to avoid not functioning scripts and functions, that demand 
               and accept the CommandIDs only!
