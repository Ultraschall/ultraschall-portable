                <h2><a id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2>
                Reaper does manage and include a lot of human-readable files, that give you the chance to change Reaper even further. With many of them being changeable, you have more chances to customize(or even debug your configuration of) Reaper to your liking, beyond the menus and APIs that Reaper provides. <br> 
                Most of them are stored as .ini-files, so they should be easily spotted. Others aren't as easily identified as customizeable and need more knowledge in how to dig into them.<p>  
                They are covered in this section.<p>
                <h3>CAUTION!</h3>
                Create a backup of a file, before you change it, as some changes in the files themselves can destroy the configuration of Reaper or your projects.<br>
                Be aware, that a lot of information is probably still missing in this documentation. Keep that in mind!<p>
                </div>
            <div style="width: 95%;">
                                <hr>
                <a id="Reaper-kb.ini"></a><h2>Reaper-kb.ini (as of Reaper 6.59)</h2>
                Stored in Reaper-ressources-folder or in the Reaper-Application-Folder(in portable installations)<p>
                    In the file Reaper-kb.ini, the custom shortcuts, scripts and acts, their descriptions, sections-association and Action-Command-IDs are defined.<p> 
                    The reaper-kb.ini does NOT store OSC-Keybindings or FX-shortcuts, they are stored in reaper-osc-actions.ini or reaper-fxoptions.ini respectively.<p>

                    Entries in Reaper-kb.ini seem to overwrite entries, defined within Reaper.<br>
                    Every entry must be written in it's own line. If you put two or more definitions in one line, even correctly after another, they will be ignored by Reaper.<br>
                    Lines with nothing or some kind of text seem to be ignored by Reaper, as long as they don't follow the scheme at all. They will be deleted, when you associate a new shortcut within Reaper, leading to the file Reaper-kb.ini newly written.<br>
                    Lines that are not correctly in their syntax, are normally ignored by Reaper. They can, however, lead to weirdly interpreted entries in the Action Command List. They might change, if you create a new shortcut within Reaper, leading to the file Reaper-kb.ini newly written. The "newly" changed entry is probably useless. So, if you're testing shortcuts you write into Reaper-kb.ini by hand, keep a "backup-copy" of it, or you might lose it in case of syntax errors.<p> 
                    
                    The order, in which Reaper includes new entries seems not to follow a logical scheme. Especially KEY-entries seem to be included without any system at all(sometime at the beginning, sometimes at the end, sometimes inbetween). I think the order might reflect the history of when a certain shortcut was added by the developers into Reaper itself, but that needs more research.<p>

                    The file is written with CR-LF at the end of each line. That is important, if you want to do file-comparing in diff-/versioning-tools as e.g. github.<p>
                    
                    When you change shortcuts within Reaper, and the Reaper-kb.ini is rewritten, the order of the entries will be changed by Reaper.<p> 
                    
                    If you want to define actions/scripts/key to multiple sections, you need to put multiple identical entries of a action/script/key WITH the parameter for the section changed only. Sections define, whether a action/script/key appears in a specific section of the ActionListWindow as well as in the selection for the menu-editor. For instance, if there's no entry for an action with the section set to MIDI-Editor, then you can't add this action to MIDI toolbars or menus. Even writing them into <i>reaper-menu.ini</i> by hand will not work and lead Reaper to simply ignore it.<p>                                    

                    ACT - Action<br>
                    SCR - Script<br>
                    KEY - Key/Shortcut/MIDI-Note - Every single shortcut has it's own entry for a given Action Command ID<p>

                <h3>Actions(ACT):</h3>
                The "Action Command ID" for a defined ACT must be unique(for each section), or Reaper uses only the first ACT using a given Action Command ID; this goes for ACTs with the same actions([ActionCommandID]) defined.  If you have associated an "Action Command ID" to two different ACTS with different actions([ActionCommandID]) defined, both will be used, but only the first one keeps the given "Action Command ID", while the others will get new Action Command IDs associated by Reaper.<p>
                
                    <pre style="padding-left:3%;"><code><i> ACT a b "Action Command ID" "Description" ActionCommandID [ActionCommandID] [ActionCommandID] ... </i></code></pre>

                             - &1 consolidate undo points<br>
                             - &2 show in Actions-Menu<br>
                             - &amp;16 &amp;32 - Show as active if all component actions are - checkbox<br>
                             - &nbsp;&nbsp;16   0 - unchecked<br>
                             - &nbsp;&nbsp;0    0 - Active<br>
                             - &nbsp;&nbsp;0    32 - Active or indeterminate<br>

                                 
                </div><br>
                <div style="padding-left: 4%; width:85%;">
                    <i>b</i> - Section ID, in which this action can be used. Only the numbers below are allowed, any other number may lead to the entry be removed, if reaper-kb.ini is rewritten by Reaper.<br> <br>
                    <div style="padding-left:4%;">0 - Main</div>
                    <div style="padding-left:4%;">1 - action stays invisible but is kept, if Reaper rewrites the reaper-kb.ini. Toolbar-buttons with this action associated appear but don't work.</div>
                    <div style="padding-left:4%;">100 - Main (alt recording)</div>
                    <div style="padding-left:4%;">32060 - MIDI Editor</div>
                    <div style="padding-left:4%;">32061 - MIDI Event List Editor</div>

                <i>"Action Command ID"</i> - your defined Action Command ID for this Action. Must be in quotes " ".<p>
                <i>"Description"</i> - a description for the Action. If multiple Actions have the same name, Reaper will show the second one as "Description(2)"<p>
                <i>ActionCommandID...[ActionCommandID]...</i> - one or more Actions/Scripts (write here their correspondent ActionCommandIDs or CommandID-numbers) you want to have executed, when this Action is triggered. Maximum length for the whole ACT-entry is 1023 characters. ActionCommandIDs or CommandID-numbers that exceed that length will be cut short(maybe even in the middle of an ActionCommandID-string), when <i>reaper-kb.ini</i> is rewritten. More actions can be included within Reaper temporarily, but they will not be saved, if the ACT + all the information including ActionCommandIDs, etc after it exceeds 1023 characters in total.<p>
                </div>
                <h3>Scripts(SCR):</h3>
                If you have given an ActionCommandID to more scripts(associated to only one section), the first script in the Reaper-kb.ini having the given ActionCommandID, will be used in Reaper.<br>
                If you need to have a single script twice in Reaper within the same section, give it individual ActionCommandIDs.<br>
                If you have given multiple scripts the same ActionCommandID, only the first gets the ActionCommandID, while the others will get a new one by Reaper!<p>
                    <pre style="padding-left:3%;"><code><i> SCR a b ActionCommandID "ScriptDescription*" Scriptname.lua|.py </i></code></pre>
                <div style="padding-left: 4%; width:85%;">
                    <i>a</i> - leave it at 4 or one of the numbers below, as most other number makes this script unrunnable, though other settings seem to have an effect, though useless when the script doesn't run. 1 consolidate undo points, 2 show in Actions-Menu, 3 consolidate undo points AND show in Actions Menu, 4 shows a "Instance already running"-dialog-window(standardsetting), 200 and above (mostly) makes the entry disappear in Reaper and within the Reaper-kb.ini, if the file is rewritten by Reaper.<p>
                        <div style="padding-left:4%;">4 - Dialogwindow appears(Terminate, New Instance, Abort), if another instance of a given script is started, that's already running</div>
                        <div style="padding-left:4%;">260 - always Terminate All(!) Instances, if you try to run another instance of a script, that's already running. When no instance is running, it simply starts the script.</div>
                        <div style="padding-left:4%;">516 - always start a New Instance of the script, that's already running</div><br>
                </div><div style="padding-left: 4%; width:85%;">
                    <i>b</i> - Section ID, in which this script can be used. Only the numbers below are allowed, any other number may lead to the entry be removed, if reaper-kb.ini is rewritten by Reaper.<br> <br>
                    <div style="padding-left:4%;">0 - Main</div>
                    <div style="padding-left:4%;">1 - action stays invisible but is kept, if Reaper rewrites the reaper-kb.ini. Menu-buttons with this action associated appear but don't work.</div>
                    <div style="padding-left:4%;">100 - Main (alt recording)</div>

                    <i>ActionCommandID</i> - your defined ActionCommandID for this script<p>
                    <i>"ScriptDescription*"</i> - must be in quotes " ". If <i>a</i> is set to 4 and you begin the description with "Custom: ", Reaper will show "Scripts: " in the description-fields of the "Show-Action-List"-dialogue. Reaper seems to like to end a description with a *, though it seems to work without it as well.<p>
                    <i>Scriptname.lua|.py|.eel</i> - the filename of the script. Reaper doesn't check, whether the actual file exists!<br>
                </div>

                <h3>Keys and Shortcuts(KEY):</h3>
                Defined Keys and Shortcuts must be unique within their section, or the last association of a given shortcut in the Reaper-kb.ini overwrites all prior given associations.<p>

                <pre style="padding-left:3%;"><code><i> KEY ModifierValue Key_Note_Value _ActionCommandID section </i></code></pre>                

                
                    
                The system, with which Reaper stores it's shortcut-values is quite odd and doesn't seem to be a logical
                system per sé. In fact, some of the rules (especially for odd and even modifier-values described below), may be wrong in edge-cases.
                Check twice, before accepting these rules as given.<p>

                <i>ModifierValue</i> - 0-256, after that, it's repeating itself<br>
                <i>Key_Note_Value</i> - 0-255 or 0-65535(with MIDI XX YY YY), after that, it's repeating.<p>

                The following modifer-values exist:<p>
                <div style="padding-left: 4%;">

                    The Note/Key-Values go from 0-255 and include the Modifier, means:<br>
                    0 65 is "nothing" "Shift+A"<br>
                    After 255, the codes repeat themselves every 256 values, but this time pure ASCII without(!) the modifier.<br>
                    There's an exception, though: the key-values 32801 to 32815 have additional keys like PgUp, PgDn, Ins, Del, Home, End, etc.<p>
                    Only useful ASCII-codes can be associated, means, ASCII-codes that are represented as a key(but not necessarily on english-keyboards!). Those modifier-values, who include the modifier do not include them necessarily in a logical way, means: even if some act like Shift+A, some others may act as e.g. Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Keyvalue. Why that is, needs more research.<p>

                    <u>Behavior of "factory-default"-shortcuts</u>
                    <div style="padding-left: 4%;">
                    Reaper sets a lot of shortcuts to actions by default, e.g. "Transport: Play/stop" has set Space as a default-shortcut. These are not set in the reaper-kb.ini !<br>
                    However, if you delete such a factory-default-shortcut, the shortcut will be added into reaper-kb.ini, but associated with the action 0, e.g. space will be set to "KEY 1 32 0 0"<br>
                    That way, you can find out, whether specific factory-default-shortcuts are set or not at all: if they aren't set to another action and not set to action 0, then they are used by Reaper as factory-default-shortcut.<p>
                    </div>

                    <u>Global shortcuts</u><p>

                    <div style="padding-left: 4%;">
                    Global keybinding can be stored only in main and main-alt-sections.
                    
                    Each global keybinding consists of two KEY-entries in the reaper-kb.ini-file, one for the keybinding to an Action Command ID, which is of the format:<p>
                        <div style="padding-left: 4%;">
                        <i>KEY modifier keyvalue action_command_id section</i>
                        </div><p>

                    which holds the keybinding itself(read chapter above for further information about them).<br>

                    In addition to that, there's a second KEY-entry, following the first KEY-entry, which holds the global-shortcut-state. <br>
                    This is of the following format:<p>
                    <div style="padding-left: 4%;">
                        <i>KEY  modifier  keyvalue  global_key_scope  section</i>
                     </div><p>

                     modifier and keyvalue are the same as the first KEY-entry, where global_key_scope and section differ.
                     <div style="padding-left: 4%;">
                            <i>global_key_scope:</i>
                            <div style="padding-left: 4%;">
                                1   - global<br>
                                101 - global+textfields
                             </div>

                            <i>section:</i>
                                <div style="padding-left: 4%;">
                                102 - main(global shortcuts)<br>
                                103 - main-alt(global shortcuts)
                                </div>
                      </div><p>

                    Example: <p>

                    a global keybinding of the key "Q", associated with the action:<br>
                        <div style="padding-left: 4%;">
                            1007 - Transport: Play
                        </div><p>
                            
                        in section main is store in the reaper-kb.ini as<p>
                        <div style="padding-left: 4%;">
                            KEY 1 81 1007 0<br>
                            KEY 1 81 1 102
                        </div><p>

                    where the first entry holds the keybinding of the q-key to the play-action and the second sets the keybinding to global without(!) textfields.
                    </div>

                    Preset-Files are to store the individual settings of presets. It will only contain your own settings you've stored, not "factory-presets". Every plugin has one preset file, each file is named <i>"VST/JS/AU/Pluginname.ini"</i>.<p>

                        Values or data you include, must be written after the = i.e. NbPresets=3. Empty lines are allowed and ignored by Reaper as well as lines containing anything, as long as they don't match the preset/general entry-scheme. Should be kept by Reaper, when new presets are added from within Reaper.<p>

                        The order of the presets can be unordered, means, Preset 9 can be appear before Preset 1 in the preset file. Reaper orders for it's preset-selection-list internally, according to the ascending ID-numbering. [General] can also be anywhere in the file, as long as it's not within a preset-entry, means: it must be either at the beginning of the file, the end of the file, or it must happen after the name= entry and before the next [PresetID]. New presets stored from within Reaper, will be added at the end of the file.<br>
                        Presets with a higher number than NbPresets-1 will be ignored by Reaper.<br>
                        If you have "missing presets", i.e. only Preset1 and Preset10 defined and not 2-9, then Reaper will show 8 empty presets between Preset1 and Preset10 in the preset-selection-list.<br>
                        If you have more presets sharing the same ID, only the first one with the given ID will appear.<p>

                        <i>Len</i> - Length of Data. Seems to be calculated like this (LengthOfData*2)-2. Don't change, as it renders this preset either not do anything(Len smaller than original value) or do strange things(Len bigger than original value).<p>

                    <a id="ReaperConfigZip"></a><h2>ReaperConfigZip - configuration-export-files</h2>
                    Can be located anywhere. Standard-save folder is Configurations in the ressources-folder or the application-folder(the latter in portable installations).<p>
                    
                        ReaperConfigZip-files are to store an exported state of Reaper with all it's configurations, files and needed stuff.<p>
                        A <i>filename.ReaperConfigZip</i> is a simple ZIP-file, created by the export-function in the <i>Preferences->General</i>-menu.<br>
                        Export mostly copies the files and folders (with some limitations described later below) and creates an additional file within the ReaperConfigZip-file: <i>reaper-configzip-info</i><br>
                        A ReaperConfigZip-file MUST contain a valid <i>reaper-configzip-info</i> file, or Reaper doesn't accept it for import! <p>


                        Only the standard-reaper-folders from the ressources-folder are supported. Additional folders i.e. "TestFoo123/" and it's files will NOT be imported, even if they exist in the ReaperConfigZip-file.<br>
Some folders and files from the ressources-folder will not be exported: <i>Configurations/, MIDINotenames/, OSC/, PreviousConfigFiles/, UserPlugins/</i>, as well as non ini files from the root-folder(Reaper only looks at filenames, not into the file itself, so a flac renamed as .ini works). It also seems to exclude files, that are from a standard-Reaper-configuration. If you want to have a standard-Reaper-config, empty the ressources-folder and start Reaper. They will be automatically created.<br>
There is only a limited number of fileformats allowed in the root-folder. That goes for import as well as export of the ressources-folder and ReaperConfigZip-file itself.  There are only files allowed like .ini, sometimes .txt. Other fileformats will not be imported, no matter if they are described in the <i>reaper-configzip-info</i>-file or not. This limitation does not necessarily go with the subfolders though, i.e. while root does not allow png or flac, the Scripts-folder does allow AND export/import them!<p>
There seems to be a limitation in regards of exported JS-FX-plugin files from the Effects-folder, with not all JS-FX being exported. This could be because of the unexported JS-FX being standard-configuration-files created by Reaper. Needs more research!<p>
Files can be described in the reaper-configzip-info, but will be imported/exported anyway, as long as they follow the file-type-restrictions of the Effects and the root-folders.<p>

                    <h4>reaper-configzip-info</h4>
                    Begins with FLAGS. The FLAGS show, which category shall be exported/imported to(all folders from the ressources-folder of Reaper).<br>
                    It must contain the FLAGS of the categories, you want to import. All files from categories not included after FLAG will cause Reaper to ignore these other files in the ReaperConfigZip-file. Means, if you don't FLAG reascripts, the Scripts will NOT be imported, even if they exist in the ReaperConfigZip-file. A simple FLAGS in the file is not sufficient! In case of doubt, include all FLAGS.<p>
                    The following FLAGS are supported. They represent the individual categories in the Export/Import dialogue:<br>
<div style="padding-left:4%;">
<i>configex</i> - Configuration(.ini) files from the root-folder of ressources-folder<br>
<i>ctheme</i> - Colorthemes - from the ColorThemes-folder<br>
<i>preset</i> - Plug-in presets - Presets from the presets-folder<br>
<i>fxchain</i> - FX chains - FXChains from the folder FXChains<br>
<i>jseffect</i> - JS-effect-plugins in Effects-folder<br>
<i>templatemisc</i> - Project and track templates/Misc data - Templates and miscellaneous data from the TrackTemplates-folder and Data-folder<br>
<i>cursorkeymap</i> - Cursor and key maps - Keymaps from the folder Keymaps<br>
<i>menus</i> - Menu and toolbars - Menu-settings from /Reaper-menu.ini<br>
<i>actions</i> - Menu sets-Actions - MenuSets-folder <br>
<i>actionsreal</i> - Actions and key bindings - reaper-kb.ini<br>
<i>menusets</i> - Menu sets - files from the MenuSets-folder<br>
<i>chanmaps</i> - Channel mappings - Channel-Mappings from ChanMaps <br>
<i>reascript</i> - Reascripts - Reascripts(Python,Eel,Lua,png) from Scripts-Folder<br>
<i>langpacks</i> - Language Packs - Languagepacks from LangPack-Folder<br>
<i>mediadb</i> - Media Explorer Databases - Media Explorer Database from MediaDB-folder<br>
<i>wwwroot</i> - Web Interface Pages - Web Interface-pages from reaper_www_root (not the one from Applicationfolder/Plugins/reaper_www_root !)<br>
<i>autoitems</i> - Automation Items stored in folder AutomationItems<br>
<i>midinotenames</i> - MIDINoteNames-aliases stored in folder MIDINoteNames<br>
</div><p>
    FLAGS must be written directly after FLAG with a space between them, i.e.:<p>
                    <i style="padding-left:4%;">FLAGS configex ctheme wwwroot</i><p>

    After the FLAGS- individual entries for each file in the ReaperConfigZip follow, with a SHA-1 hash.<p>
    Every file entry starts with <i>SHA (SHA-1-HashValueofFile) "[Directory\]Filename.extension"</i>. <br>The hashvalue MUST be a valid SHA-1-Hashvalue of the file within ReaperConfigZip, or else, it will be ignored by Reaper-Import. The hash seems to be to help Reaper finding out, if a file that exists, has changed(replace) or not(No change).<br>
    Every entry as well as the end of the FLAGS-entries(after wwwroot), ends with the Hex-value 00. Seems to work with a simple SPACE as well, though.<br>
    The reaper-configzip-info file seems to work with only the FLAG - section. But prefer to include the <i>SHA (SHA-1-HashValueofFile) "[Directory\]Filename.extension"</i>, as this is standard behavior of Reaper.<p>
    Important: If you want to create a ReaperConfigZip-file, accepted by Reaper, you must zip using the option "do not add directory entries" or Reaper will show error-messages during import. This is because the importer can create files+their paths but not an empty directory.

                    <a id="ReaperKeyMap"></a><h2>ReaperKeyMap</h2>
                    You can have this file anywhere. Standard-folder for export/import is KeyMaps in Ressources-folder of Reaper or in the application-folder of Reaper(the latter in portable installations).<p>
                </div>This file is basically an exported selection of entries of the <a href="#Reaper-kb.ini">Reaper-kb.ini</a>, chosen for export in the Actions->Show Actions List-dialogue.<br>
                In fact, the reaper-kb.ini works the same way as ReaperKeyMaps, ReaperKeyMaps just have .ReaperKeyMaps as a file extension. So you could take a reaper-kb.ini, rename it to reaper-kb.ReaperKeyMap and import it.<p>
                    Please refer the description for <a href="#Reaper-kb.ini">Reaper-kb.ini</a> for more details. The rules set for Reaper-kb.ini also apply to ReaperKeyMaps.<p>

                        <strong>This documentation is missing information, especially about MIDI and OSC linkings and LEARN! It's also missing information about DirectX as well as Apple-AU-plugins!</strong><p>

                        Default_Track_Chain.RfxChain in the FXChains-folder is default FXChains for all new tracks you create in your project. Only the Master-Track doesn't include them!<p>

<h3>Filestructure</h3>

Some sections begin with &lt; and end with &gt; while others are written in one line.<p>

<h4>First entries</h4>
<i>REQUIRED_CHANNELS val</i> <br>
<i style="padding-left:4%;">val</i>- number of required channels for all(?) plugins in this FXChain<p>

    Next there are the entry-sections for the effect themselves. Only one of them (either one of VST, JS, DX or AU)comes after the <i>BYPASS-entry</i> and before the <i>WAK</i> entry.<br>
    The second plugin will come after the next <i>BYPASS</i>, the third plugin after the third <i>BYPASS</i>, etc, etc.<p>

Settings for non existing faders are given with a - . It must have 64 entries, though it seems to work without the - given for nonexisting faders at the end of the preset. Non existing faders (-) can also occur between values! <p>
        <i>[presetname]</i> name of the preset you want to use. If there's no such preset, Reaper will use "no preset" instead.<p>

    <h4>After the VST/JS/DX/AU-section</h4>
    After the VST/JS/DX/AU-section, there are some additional entries that may occur, giving control to envelopes, MIDI/OSC-bindings, and others. Most of them are controllable through the FX-dialogue-window, mostly by clicking on the <strong>+</strong> or the <strong>param</strong> button.<p>
        
        The following entries seem to work only for VST and JS plugins, not DX(AU?)Plugins!<p></p>

            <i>PRESETNAME "name"</i><br>
        <div style="padding-left:4%;"><i>name</i> is the name of the preset. Has no effect, whatsoever, as the selected preset seems to be taken from the VST-Settings-string. So an empty name is also valid.</div><p>

                    <hr>
                    <a id="Reaper-menu.ini"></a><h2>Reaper-menu.ini</h2>
                    This file is located in the root of the Reaper-ressources-folder or the Reaper-application-folder(the latter in portable installations).<p>
                        Reaper-menu.ini files are to store the customization of menus, context-menus as well as toolbars and floating toolbars. You can customize the toolbars and menus for the MIDI-Editor as well in here.<p>
                        Note: Keep it as ANSI-encoded file, as UNICODE might cause toolbars, mostly the first described in reaper-menu.ini, to disappear(mostly Floating toolbar 1, as some characters are added right before [Floating). Unicode without BOM seems to work, though.<p>
                    
                    <h4>Menu/Toolbar-header</h4>
                    Every Menu/Toolbar-header begins with a <i>[Title]</i>. The order of the headers seems to be irrelevant, as long as they are at the beginning of each menu-entries-list. Reaper prefers alphabetically ordering, though.<br>
                    Every header must be unique, or it leads to all kind of strange behavior within the menus(menu-entries from the second header A, while the title is used from the first header A, etc). <br>You can't customize the help-menu.<p></p>
                    The following <i>[Title]</i>-headers are allowed. Anything else will lead to weird menu/toolbar behavior in Reaper: <p></p>
                        <strong>Note:</strong> the information in () like (&amp;File), isn't part of the Menu/Toolbar-header, but rather it's standard-title(refer to title entries later in this Reaper-menu.ini-doc for more details). That means, the Menu/Toolbar-entry for Main file (&amp;File) is <strong>[Main file]</strong> NOT [Main file (&amp;File)]!<p></p>

<h4>The Menu/Toolbar-entries themselves</h4>
The entries below a header can be either item_ID, title or icon_ID(icons in toolbars only!).<p></p>
<h4>Entries for menus and context-menus</h4>
<i>item_ID=a b</i>
<div style="padding-left:4%;"><p>
        <i>ID</i> - entrynumber in this menu. Don't skip IDs, as that may lead to weird behavior in menus(default-menu entries showing up, some of the entries ignored, some entries shown). Use IDs only once, as otherwise, Reaper uses only the first item with that given ID.<p></p>
    <i>a</i> - type/action of menu. The following are allowed, but only one for a given menu-entry:<br>
    <div style="padding-left:4%;">
        <i>ActionCommandID-number</i><br>
        <i>ActionCommandID-string</i>. Must begin with _ or the menu-entry disappears within Reaper<br>
        <i>-1</i> - Separator. MINUS 1, not 1!<br>
        <i>-2</i> - start new submenu within current (sub)menu. Only in menus, not in toolbars!. Submenus in submenus are allowed, but must be ended with -3.<br>
        <i>-3</i> - end of the submenu within current (sub)menu. Only in menus, not in toolbars! Submenus in submenus are allowed, but must begin with -2. <br>
        <i>-4 [Text]</i> -  Label with no action but <i>[Text]</i> in it. Good for structuring the menu for the user. Will be "greyed out" in Reaper.<p></p>
    </div>
    
    <i>b</i> - Description of the entry, as it will be shown in the menu. Some Reaper-builtin-descriptions have an &amp; in their name, while others don't. Why that is needs more research...<p></p>
</div>
    <i>title=a</i>
    <div style="padding-left:4%;"><p>
        <i>a</i> - Title for this menu, as it will be shown in Reaper. Context-menus will not show the title with the exception of the menu-editor.<p>
    </div>

    <h4>Entries for toolbars</h4>
    <i>icon_ID=a</i>
    <div style="padding-left:4%;"><p>
            <i>ID</i> - must be corresponding to the ID of the item_ID, that shall use this icon!<p></p>
            <i>a</i> - is either: 
            <div style="padding-left:4%">- <i>icon-filename</i> as stored in ressources-folder/Data/toolbar_icons or application-folder/Data/toolbar_icons/<br>
                - <i>text</i> - shows text of the title of this item-entry (refer the <i>b</i> from <i>item_ID</i> below)<br>
                    - <i>text_wide</i> - like text but double-width of the button for longer texts<br>
                    - <i>text_tt</i> - use as tooltip<p></p>
            </div>
    </div>

    <i>item_ID a b</i>
    <div style="padding-left:4%;"><p>
            <i>ID</i> - entrynumber in this menu. Important for corresponding icons in toolbars! Don't skip IDs, as all following items will be ignored by Reaper. Use IDs only once, as otherwise, Reaper uses only the first item with that given ID.<p>
            <i>a</i> - type/action of menu. The following are allowed, but only one for a given menu-entry:<br>
    <div style="padding-left:4%;">
        <i>ActionCommandID-number</i><p>
        <i>ActionCommandID-string</i> - must begin with _<p>
            <i>-1 to -infinity [Text]</i> - acts as a separator between icons, if no <i>[Text]</i> is given. If <i>[Text]</i> is given, you'll have a non-clickable-button with the <i>[Text]</i> in it. You can associate an nonclickable icon to separators, which will render <i>[Text]</i> as not to be shown.<p>
    </div>
        <i>b</i> - Title of this item-entry.<p>
    </div>
    <i>title=a</i>
    
    <div style="padding-left:4%;"><p>
            <i>a</i> - Title for this Toolbar, as it will be shown in Reaper, usually in the menu-editor.<p></p>
    </div>
    <h4>Menu only actions</h4>
    There are some actions in Reaper, that can only be accessed from the menus(not toolbars and not from the actionlist-dialog!)<p>
    In the [Brackets] you can see, where they are available in the menu by default, though some of them may be useable in other menus as well, probably depending on the action-context accepted in a specific menu.<p>

                    The <i>Reaper-extstate.ini</i> is to store persistent external states, that have been set by scripts, plugins, etc.<p>
                        You can't change persistent external states in the reaper-extstate.ini (i.e. using a texteditor) while Reaper is running, as Reaper will ignore these changes. While Reaper is running, you need to set external states using the api-function <a href="Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#SetExtState">SetExtState</a> or Reaper will not update the state, leading GetExtState showing the older state instead! Though, Reaper will change the file, when using SetExtState() even while Reaper is running.<p>
                        The structure of the file is like many of the other ini-files of Reaper. It contains sections (written in [] ). The next line is the key, set to a value.<p>

                    Whitespaces are allowed in [sections], keys and values.<p>
                    
                    A given name for <i>[sections]</i> can be in the file multiple times, but this can confuse Reaper, so avoid that.<br>
                    Names of <i>Keys</i> can be multiple time within a <i>[section]</i>, but this can confuse Reaper, so avoid that.<p></p>
                    The <i>value</i> can be either a number, a string or true or false. Spaces are allowed within these <i>values</i>. Reaper will treat a <i>value</i> as a string.<p></p>
                    There are no default sections, key or values in the <i>reaper-extstate.ini</i>, so these are freely chooseable. You can write them by hand into this file, but you should prefer using the API-Functions <a href="Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#SetExtState">SetExtState</a>, <a href="Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#GetExtState">GetExtState</a>, <a href="Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#HasExtState">HasExtState</a> and <a href="Reaper_Api_Documentation.html#DeleteExtState">DeleteExtState</a> instead.<p> 
                        Keep in mind: Only persistent External States are stored into this file and non-persistent-ones are forgotten by Reaper after exit!<br>
                        Once an external state has been made persistent, it will stay in the <i>reaper-extstate.ini</i>, even if you set it's persistancy to false. But if you set persistance of such an external state to false, Reaper will use the non-persistent(false) one instead, until you close Reaper.<p>
                    
                    The <i>Reaper-extstate.ini</i> isn't case-sensitive, so you can write entries in cAmElCaSe, lowercase or UPPERCASE.<p>

                    <a id="Reaper-mouse.ini"></a><h2>Reaper-mouse.ini</h2>
                    You can find the Reaper-mouse.ini in the ressources-folder or the Reaper-Application-folder(in portable installations).<p>
                        The Reaper-mouse.ini is to store the settings for the Mouse-modifier-settings. <br>
                        Usually, you can change them within Reaper from the <i>Options->Preferences->Mouse modifiers</i>-dialogue, with the exception of the checkboxes below the "Modifier & Beavior"-section, that are stored into the <a href="#reaper.ini">Reaper.ini</a><p>
                    
                        The Reaper-mouse.ini begins with a [hasimported]-section, before the individual [sections] with their own keys=values.<p>
                        
                        The purpose of the [hasimported]-section is unknown. Standard values for the keys is 1, though -1 seems to be accepted. What it does is unknown and needs more research.<p>

                    The individual [sections] with the behavior-settings work after the following principle:<p>
<div style="padding-left:4%;">                        
                        <strong>[sectionname]</strong><br>
                        Key_ID=Value [m|c]<br>
                        name=The text of the tooltip for a toolbar button.
</div>

The small m after the number of Key_ID means, it's a mouse modifier, a small c means, it's a command-id. _ActionCommandIDs do not have a "m" or "c" after them.
<br>
<h3>Keys used in every [section]</h3>
There are standard keys for every [section] in the <i>reaper-mouse.ini</i>. Each key is for a special key-combination within the context of the mouse-behavior.<p>
    After the = you put the value for the behavior you want to have associated with that mouseclick-keymodifier-combination(refer to "Values for Mouse-Behavior Modifiers" for all values for every [section]).<p>
    The following keys are valid. Additional Values are possible but will be ignored by Reaper(and sometimes deleted, when the reaper-mouse.ini is rewritten).<p>
<div style="padding-left:4%;">
<i>mm_0=</i> - Default Action<br>
<i>mm_1=</i> - Shift<br>
<i>mm_2=</i> - Ctrl<br>
<i>mm_3=</i> - Shift+Ctrl<br>
<i>mm_4=</i> - Alt<br>
<i>mm_5=</i> - Shift+Alt<br>
<i>mm_6=</i> - Ctrl+Alt<br>
<i>mm_7=</i> - Shift+Ctrl+Alt<br>
<strong><i>Note: There is no mm_8= or it is for the Apple-key! Needs more research.</i></strong><br>
<i>mm_9=</i> - Shift+Win / Shift+Apple(?)<br>
<i>mm_10=</i> - Ctrl+Win / Ctrl+Apple(?)<br>
<i>mm_11=</i> - Shift+Ctrl+Win<br>
<i>mm_12=</i> - Alt+Win<br>
<i>mm_13=</i> - Shift+Alt+Win<br>
<i>mm_14=</i> - Ctrl+Alt+Win<br>
<i>mm_15=</i> - Shift+Ctrl+Alt+Win<br>
</div>
<br>
<h3>Values for Mouse-Behavior Modifiers</h3>
You can choose between a lot of different behaviors for the mouse, a complete list follows below.<p>
For clickable mouse-behavior-[sections]: Unused values are filled with Reaper-CommandIDs and can be used as such (1007 triggers the play-button). <br>
Some of the CommandIDs of Reaper share the same numbers with the mouse-modifier-behavior-values. In that case, Reaper prefers the mouse-modifier-behavior-value over existing CommandIDs. <br>
You can circumvent this problem by creating a new action that uses the CommandID you want to use. After that, you can use the _ActionCommandID of the new action instead of the CommandID. In general it is preferrable to use an Action over the direct CommandID, as, in the future, the Reaper-developers may use other values for mouse-modifier-behavior instead of the CommandID, leading to wrong mouse-behavior. Though, high values(above 100) shouldn't be a problem, but you never know.<br>
<br>
Every [section] has it's own set of values you can set to each key. If you want to give simple left click on items the behavior "Select Item", the entry would look like:<p></p>
<div style="padding-left:4%;">
    [MM_CTX_ITEM_CLK]<br>
    mm_0=3 m<br>
    name=The text of the tooltip for a toolbar button.
</div>
<br>
Note: within the description you will find something like "Main-section" or "MIDI-Editor"; that is NOT a [section] but refers to the sections you have in the Actions->Show Actions List-dialoque within Reaper. The Reaper-mouse.ini-[sections] are always written as [sectionname].<p></p>
Also note: Double Click and Left Click also allows _ActionCommandIDs and CommandIDs, with the exception of the section [MM_CTX_MIDI_CCEVT]. All others don't support CommandIDs and _ActionCommandIDs.<br>
Especially note: when a default-action is selected, Reaper seems to remove the entry from the reaper-mouse.ini

                        A filename.ReaperMouseMap is a file, in which you can export your own mouse modifier for later reimport <i>(Preferences->Mouse Modifiers->Import/Export-Button).</i> <p>
                        It basically is a stripped-down-version of the <i>reaper-mouse.ini</i> with the [hasimported] section missing.<p>
                        The rules for reaper-mouse.ini also apply in ReaperMouseMaps (refer to the <a href="#Reaper-mouse.ini">description of Reaper-mouse.ini</a> for more information.)<p>

                    You can find Filename.ReaperFileList-files in the MediaDB-folder in the ressources-folder or in the Reaper-application-folder(in portable installations).<p>
                        ReaperFileList-files are databases for the Media-Explorer (within Reaper-menu: View-> Media Explorer). They contain files you have associated with that given Media-Explorer-Database.<p>
                        The name of the Media-Explorer-Database is not stored into the files, but rather into reaper.ini, section:<p>
                    <div style="padding-left:4%;">
                        <strong>[reaper_explorer] </strong><br>
                        ShortcutID=Filename.ReaperFileList<br>
                        ShortcutTID=Title of this Database<br>
                    </div>
                    <br>
                        The file itself basically consists of three different types of entrys: PATH, FILE and DATA.<p>
                        <strong>PATH</strong><p>
                        This entry contains the Path of a folder, that was made into a Media-Explorer-Database. It usually appears only, when you choose "Make Database from Current Folder"-context-menu-entry.<p>
                    <div style="padding-left:4%;">
                        <i>PATH "Path to the files"</i>
                    </div><br>
                    The path to the files must be written in quotes ""<p></p>
                    <strong>FILE</strong><p>
                        The FILE entry contains the path and filename to a given media-file plus some additional information. There is only a limited number of formats allowed, like: aif, avi, dat, flac, m4a, mid, mov, mp2, mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpg, ogg, opus, rex, rpp, RTrackTemplate, wav, webm, wma, wmv, xml.<br>
                        Reaper seems not to check, whether the files are actually the format, they claim to be by their extension.<p>
                        Every FILE-entry works as follows:
                    <div style="padding-left:4%;">
                        <i>FILE "Path\Filename.ext" a b c</i><p>
                        
                            <i>a</i> - Filesize in Kilobytes<br>
                            <i>b</i> - unknown, standardsetting is 0<br>
                            <i>c</i> - an encoded timestamp of the file<br>
                    </div>
                    <strong>DATA</strong><p>
                    DATA-entries contain the metadata that was stored in the media-files. Only Metadata of MP3 and WAV-files will be added to DATA-entries. Metadata in other Media(like m4a) will be ignored.<p>
                        A DATA-entry must be written directly below the FILE-entry, that contains the file with that metadata, or Reaper doesn't know, which file did this metadata come from.<p>
                        One Metadata-field is mandatory, but you can freely choose, which one from those below. You must retain the order, so you can't use the meta-entry for genre before artist!<br>
                        If a metadata-field has a white-space in it, it must be enclosed in "" i.e. a:IamTheArtist "a:I am The Artist".<p>
                        The following meta-data-entries are allowed: 
                <div style="padding-left:4%;">
                    t: Trackname<br>
                    a: artist<br>
                    b: Album<br>
                    y: Year-field<br>
                    g: genre<br>
                    c: comment<br>
                    p: BPM<br>
                </div><br>
                Not all fields are necessary and can be skipped, but the order must be maintained.<br>

                        It is to store the information about the color-settings for the Reaper-Integrated-Development-Environment.<p>
                        You can store and load it, if you open the Theme-Tweak-Editor (CommandID: 41930 "Theme Development: Show theme tweak/configuration window") or in the menu: Options->Themes->Show Theme Editor(only with SWS-installed).<br>
                        In the editor, quite at the lower end of all entries, there is a section "ReaScript/JSFX/Video IDE (non-theme) -- click for options". Click on it for options of saving and loading a ReaperIDEtheme.<br>
                        If a theme is loaded, the key <i>ide_colors</i>, with all it's entries, will be added to the <a href="#reaper.ini">reaper.ini</a>-section [REAPER].<p>
                        The file begins with [REAPER_IDE_THEME].<p>
                        Next comes the key <i>ide-colors=</i> with the 30 individual rgb-color-values following after it, separated by a simple whitespace. Each rgb-color-value is written in hexadecimal values, rrggbb (i.e. Full red would be FF0000).<p>
                        The values are associated to the following elements within the IDE-Window in the following order:<p>

Hardware-channels can be used by multiple alias-channels. You can also associate more hardware-channels, than your hardware has; they will appear but not be useful if you load the ReaperChanMap into Reaper unless you use a hardware, that has minimum the number of hardware-channels you've associated in that given ReaperChanMap.<p>
    Multiple use of the same ID in nameID leaves Reaper to use the first one only, while giving the others no associated channel, even if you've associated one using the same ID in chID. In fact, when using the same ID multiple times, Reaper seems to ignore the ID in nameID, using the order nameID-keys for it's numbering. So a name0= is aliasname for the first channel, while a second name0= is the aliasname for the second channel.<br>
    The file works without the nameID-keys. It also works without any chID-keys; Reaper will associate no hardware-channel to them.<p>
    Keys can be skipped and be ordered in anyway you like, as long as the ID are correct.<p>
    If, by using the Channel-Mapping-dialogue in Reaper, none of the nameID are given, the import of the ChanMap shows no channels at all. In addition map_hwnch and map_size are set to 0. You can change map_hwnch and map_size to a higher number, to make the file loadable again.<p>

    If map_size is bigger than the number of alias channels(nameID and chID keys) defined in the ReaperChanMap, the other channels will be set to not connected, when loading the file.<p>

    When loaded, the ReaperChanMap information is added to the Reaper.ini, using the keys [alias_in_$devicename] [alias_out_$devicename]. The $devicename depends on the hardware, you have set as audio-hardware to use within Reaper, means: you can use the same ReaperChanMap for different recording-devices. Reaper makes the difference by putting $devicename into the section within <a href="#reaper.ini">reaper.ini</a><p>
