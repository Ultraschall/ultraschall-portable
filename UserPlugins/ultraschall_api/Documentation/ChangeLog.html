You can insert them with the new item function InsertMediaItem_MediaItemStateChunk - Rendering: Render projectfiles as mp3, mp3_vbr, mp3_cbr, mp3_abr, opus, flac, aiff, and webm(video).

<p>####Changes from 4.00beta1 to 4.00beta2 - Marker/Regions-functions - they used to ignore regions which led to wrong markers/regions -&gt; fixed - ultraschall.WriteValueToFile - default write-mode changed to binary-file behavior(doesn’t add useless newlines anymore) non binary-mode can be chosen by a new parameter “binarymode” set to false, if it’s<br />
set to nil or true, value will be treated as binaryvalue and saved as such. ultraschall.WriteValueToFile(Filename_with_path, Value, binarymode) - CSV2IndividualLines - renamed to CSV2IndividualLinesAsArray and added number of lines as additional return-value - NumberRangeAsCsvOfNumbers - renamed to CreateTrackNumbersString - Structure - reworked API-structure</p>
